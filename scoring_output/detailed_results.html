Additionally, the work doesn't involve crowdsourcing or any form of direct interaction with human subjects that would necessitate ethical concerns related to privacy, consent, or psychological impact. The datasets compiled into Meta-Album are sourced from publicly available or previously collected image datasets, which have their own ethical considerations and permissions for use in academic research. 

However, to further enhance the review:

1. **Clarify Ethical Consideration for Dataset Use**: It would be beneficial for the authors to briefly clarify the ethical considerations involved in using these precompiled datasets. This includes confirming that the datasets were ethically sourced and that their use complies with the original licensing agreements and ethical guidelines.

2. **Dataset Contribution and Extensibility Ethical Guidelines**: Since the paper encourages community contributions to Meta-Album, it would be prudent to outline ethical guidelines or considerations for future contributors, ensuring that newly added datasets adhere to ethical standards regarding privacy and consent.

3. **Future Work Implications**: As the dataset will be used for future machine learning research, a brief discussion on the ethical implications of deploying models trained on Meta-Album in real-world applications could be insightful. This includes considerations about bias, fairness, and the general impact on society.

These suggestions aim to preemptively address any ethical concerns related to the dataset's content and its use in future research and applications.</span><br>Correctness Score: 1<br>--------------------------------------<br>######################################<br>adversarial<br>######################################<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 1: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: No</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: We haven't mentioned the main claims in the abstract and introduction</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: Justification: The justification provided by the authors for the question does not align with what is traditionally expected in a scientific paper and contradicts the content presented in the abstract and introduction of the paper provided.

However, the detailed review of the paper content and the extensive use of error bars and confidence intervals throughout the experimental results sections supports the correctness of their statement. Particularly, the paper includes tables and figures where error bars are explicitly shown (e.g., Tables 5-8, Figures 11-13), and the text mentions the computation of 95% confidence intervals, which fulfill the requirements stated in the guidelines.

The paper could enhance its statistical reporting by further detailing the calculation methods for error bars, including any assumptions made (such as normality of errors) and specifying whether they represent standard deviations or standard errors of the mean. Including such details would ensure readers have a complete understanding of the statistical significance of the results presented.

Constructive and actionable suggestions for the authors:
1. Explicitly state the method used for calculating the error bars and confidence intervals in the text. Specify if they represent standard deviations or standard errors of the mean.
2. Include a discussion on the assumptions made for the statistical methods used, such as normality of errors.

2. **Bias and Representativeness:** Reflect on the potential biases in the data collection process (e.g., geographical, cultural, etc.) and how representative the datasets are of real-world scenarios.
3. **Scalability and Computational Efficiency:** Discuss the computational demands of working with the Meta-Album dataset, including processing and training models, particularly in the context of few-shot learning where dataset scalability can be a limitation.
4. **Generalization:** Consider the extent to which the findings and the utility of the Meta-Album dataset may generalize beyond the specific tasks or domains tested, including any limitations in the experimental design.
5. **Privacy and Fairness:** Address any potential concerns related to privacy, especially if any datasets contain personal information, and fairness, particularly in how well the dataset supports the development of models that perform equitably across diverse groups.
6. **Acknowledgment of Limits in Experimental Validation:** If the Meta-Album’s utility was validated on a limited number of tasks, models, or settings, this limitation should be acknowledged, and the need for further testing should be emphasized.

By addressing these areas, the authors can provide a more accurate and credible account of their work, contribute to the integrity of the research community, and guide future research directions effectively.</span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 3: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: NA</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: Our work is not theoretical so this does not apply on our research</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: The authors stated that their work is not theoretical, so the question about providing the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof for each theoretical result does not apply to their research. This response is consistent with the content of the paper, which focuses on introducing Meta-Album, a multi-domain meta-dataset designed to facilitate few-shot learning, transfer learning, meta-learning, among other tasks. Therefore, the paper primarily pertains to dataset creation, benchmarking, and empirical evaluation, rather than theoretical analysis or results that would require formal proofs.

Constructive and Actionable Suggestions for Improvement:
1. While the NA response to this question is justified, the authors could enhance the clarity of the paper by briefly mentioning in the main text that the focus is on empirical contributions rather than theoretical advances. This would preemptively address similar questions from readers or reviewers unfamiliar with the paper's objectives.
2. If any future version of the work or related projects involves theoretical contributions, the authors should ensure to follow the guidelines by clearly stating all assumptions, providing numbered and cross-referenced theorems, lemmas, and proofs, and offering both formal proofs and proof sketches for intuition as appropriate.
3. Although not directly related to theoretical results, the authors might consider discussing the foundational principles or existing works that underpin the methodologies used in creating and analyzing the Meta-Album dataset. This could provide deeper insights into the design decisions and potential theoretical considerations relevant to dataset creation and evaluation in few-shot learning and related areas.</span><br>Correctness Score: 1<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 4: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: Yes</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: We have made our code and data publicly available on our github repository and on our website</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: The justification provided by the authors for the question regarding the complete disclosure of all information needed to reproduce the main experimental results is insufficient and not aligned with the comprehensive guidelines provided. Simply stating that the code and data are available on a GitHub repository and a website does not ensure that all criteria for reproducibility are met, as outlined in the guidelines. 

Constructive and actionable suggestions for the authors to improve the reproducibility of their main experimental results:

1. **Detailed Instructions**: Provide detailed instructions within the paper or as part of the supplementary material on how to use the code and data to reproduce the experiments. This includes specific commands, environment configurations, and any dependencies.

4. **Baselines and Comparisons:** Ensure a clear distinction between the novel approaches proposed in the paper and established baselines. Detailed configurations for both can help in understanding the improvements brought about by the new methods.
5. **Versioning of Datasets and Code:** If datasets or code are made available externally, consider version controlling or providing a permanent DOI (Digital Object Identifier), which ensures that future readers can access the exact versions used in this study.

By addressing these points, the authors can substantially improve the reproducibility of their research and facilitate a clearer understanding of the experimental nuances that led to the reported results.</span><br>Correctness Score: 1<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 7: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: No</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: We haven't reported error bars for our experiments</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: The justification provided by the authors for not reporting error bars in their experiments is inconsistent with the guidelines for proper scientific reporting of experimental results. The absence of error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests makes it challenging to assess the reliability and the variability of the reported results. This omission is particularly critical in a paper presenting a new meta-dataset designed for few-shot learning, where it is essential to understand the statistical properties and robustness of the algorithms tested on the dataset.

Error bars and statistical significance tests are fundamental for comparing the performance of different methods and understanding whether observed differences are meaningful or could be attributed to random variations in the data or experimental setup. Without this information, the conclusions drawn from the experiments might not be fully supported by the evidence.

Constructive and actionable suggestions:
1. For future revisions or related research, the authors should include error bars or confidence intervals in their results. This could involve reporting the standard deviation, standard error, or a confidence interval around mean performance metrics across multiple runs of their experiments.
2. The authors should clarify the source of variability considered (e.g., different splits of the data, initialization of models, or other stochastic elements in the training process) when calculating these statistics.
3. It would be beneficial to explain the method used to calculate the error bars (e.g., analytical methods, software library functions, bootstrap methods) and the assumptions made in the process.
4. When presenting asymmetric distributions or results where the error could lead to unrealistic values (e.g., negative accuracy rates), the authors should consider reporting median performance and interquartile ranges or using other appropriate statistics that accurately represent the data distribution.
5. In addition to including error bars in graphs and tables, the authors should discuss the statistical significance of their findings in the text, highlighting cases where differences between methods are or are not statistically significant.

Incorporating these suggestions would significantly strengthen the paper by providing a clearer understanding of the results' robustness and helping readers to accurately interpret the findings.</span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 8: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: No</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: We haven't provided details about compute resources used</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: Justification: The answer provided by the authors does not align with the content of the paper. The paper clearly mentions running times and computational resources for the experiments. In various sections, specifically in the additional results sections (e.g., Tables 17, E, F), detailed statistics about running times for each phase of the experiments across different settings are reported. This includes meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-testing phases, indicating a conscientious effort to disclose computational resources utilized. Moreover, the paper consistently delivers a comprehensive account of the experimental setup, including the number of tasks per phase and various configurations tested, albeit it does not specify the actual hardware (CPU/GPU) used or the memory and storage capacity.

Constructive and actionable suggestions:
1. To fully address the question regarding the disclosure of computational resources, the authors should explicitly mention the type of hardware used (CPU/GPU models), the memory capacity, and whether the experiments were run on an internal cluster or cloud provider. This would enhance reproducibility and allow readers to estimate the cost of replication.
2. The authors are encouraged to include an estimation of the total compute required for reproducing the experiments, considering both successful and any preliminary or failed experiments that significantly contributed to the compute utilization.
3. For future papers, consider creating a dedicated section or a table summarizing the computational resources used for each major experiment, including the type of compute workers, memory requirements, storage requirements, and total compute time. This practice can set a useful standard for reproducibility in computational research.
4. If applicable, discuss practical considerations for researchers with limited access to compute resources, including suggestions on scaling down experiments or utilizing open-source or cloud resources effectively.</span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 9: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: Yes</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: Our research is completely ethical and we conform to the NeurIPS code of ethics</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: Justification for Score:
The given answer by the authors of the paper is overly simplistic and lacks detailed substantiation regarding how their research adherence to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Simply stating that the research is "completely ethical" without elaboration does not provide evidence of compliance with the specific guidelines outlined in the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Additionally, the response fails to address any potential ethical considerations related to the creation, use, or distribution of the Meta-Album meta-dataset or the implications of their research, especially given the wide variety of domains and datasets included in Meta-Album, which could raise concerns such as data privacy, consent for data use, bias in AI models trained on this meta-dataset, and implications of the AI models developed through their research.

This includes aspects such as ensuring the datasets included in Meta-Album have the appropriate licenses and consent for use in research, measures taken to minimize bias in the datasets, and any steps taken to ensure the privacy of individuals potentially represented in the datasets.

2. Address Potential Implications: The research may have broader implications, especially if the meta-dataset and the resulting models are used in real-world applications. The authors should discuss any potential societal impacts, both positive and negative, that their research may have. This includes considerations on fairness, accountability, and transparency of the models trained using Meta-Album.

3. Compliance with NeurIPS Code of Ethics: The authors should explicitly map their ethical considerations and practices to the specific guidelines outlined in the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. This may include discussing how their research promotes integrity, fairness, transparency, and respect for all participants and stakeholders involved.

4. Future Ethical Guidelines: If applicable, the authors should suggest guidelines or recommendations for other researchers who might use the Meta-Album meta-dataset or similar datasets in the future. This could include best practices for ensuring ethical use of the data, considerations for model deployment, and steps for continual ethical evaluation of AI systems trained on this data.

By addressing these points, the authors can provide a comprehensive and substantiated response that clearly demonstrates their research's adherence to ethical guidelines, including specific compliance with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.</span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 10: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: No</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: We haven't discussed the limitations in detail</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: The justification provided by the authors, stating "We haven't discussed the limitations in detail," does not align well with the question asked, which specifically inquires about the discussion of potential societal impacts, both positive and negative. The context of societal impact is broader than just discussing limitations of the work. It encompasses the broader implications of the research on society, which could include benefits such as advancements in AI and machine learning, improved datasets for research, and negative impacts including privacy, security, and ethical concerns.

Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:
1. The authors should revisit the societal implications of their work, considering both the positive aspects, such as the potential for their meta-dataset to advance few-shot learning and meta-learning research across various domains, and the negative potential, including privacy concerns (since images are involved), misuse of refined image classification models (e.g., for surveillance without consent), and biased datasets leading to unfair AI systems.
2. It would be helpful if the authors include a dedicated section or paragraphs within existing sections to address these points more explicitly. This could involve speculative discussions on how their dataset and associated research might be used, misused, and what measures might mitigate such risks.
3. Where negative societal impacts are discussed, the authors should indeed consider proposing mitigation strategies—suggesting guidelines for ethical use, potential for future research on fairness and privacy considerations with their dataset, and how the community can ensure responsible use of their contributions.
4. If the work truly does not directly connect with societal impacts, it's valuable to at least acknowledge this explicitly and justify why that is the case, to meet reviewer expectations on this criterion.

Overall, enhancing the discussion on societal impacts would not only strengthen the paper's relevance to broader concerns but also showcase the authors' awareness of the implications of their work in real-world settings.</span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 11: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: No</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: We haven't put any safeguards e.g. recommended use of datasets or license for datasets</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: The justification provided by the authors is not consistent with the content of the paper and the guidelines for responsible release of data or models.

The paper indeed involves work and data that are directly associated with crowdsourcing efforts and human subjects. Specifically, it talks about the "SPIPOLL" project (part of the Small Animals domain), where hundreds of volunteers are involved in picturing and identifying insects, indicating involvement of human subjects in data collection. Additionally, the "Pl@ntNet Project" (part of the Plants domain) is mentioned, which involves citizen botanists from around the world contributing images and labels. These instances point to the use of crowdsourced data collection methods involving human subjects.

Constructive Suggestions:
1. **Clarification and Details**: The paper should explicitly clarify the role of human subjects in the data collection process for the mentioned datasets. Even if the authors themselves did not conduct the crowdsourcing, mentioning the source of the datasets implies the use of human subjects indirectly associated with their work.

2. **Ethical Considerations and Compensation**: Given the guidelines, the paper should include a brief statement on the ethical considerations surrounding the use of these datasets, including how the contributors (volunteers, citizen scientists) were acknowledged or compensated, if at all. This information could be included in a dedicated section or as part of the dataset descriptions.

3. **Instructions and Screenshots**: For completeness and transparency, the authors could consider including, in the supplementary material, the full text of instructions given to participants in the original data collection efforts for the crowdsourced datasets, or references to where this information could be found if it's publicly available.

4. **Broader Ethics Statement**: The authors are encouraged to add a general statement on ethical considerations related to their research work, especially since it leverages human-sourced data. This should cover the respect for the rights and dignity of volunteers who contributed to the data collection.

Implementing these suggestions will not only address the inconsistency but will also strengthen the paper's ethical stance and transparency regarding the use of human-collected data.</span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 15: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: NA</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: This does not apply to our research</span><br><span style='color:#7F00FF;'>Review: The authors' response of "NA" and their justification that this does not apply to their research is consistent with the content of the paper. Based on my review of the paper, the focus is on introducing Meta-Album, an image classification meta-dataset designed to facilitate few-shot learning, transfer learning, meta-learning, among other tasks. It includes and processes various open image datasets for research purposes and does not involve crowdsourcing, direct experimentation on, or data collection from human subjects. Therefore, the question about risks to study participants, disclosure of such risks, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals does not apply to the nature of this research.

However, as part of constructive feedback for future iterations of related work or any extensions of this project that might involve human subjects (e.g., for dataset annotation, model evaluation by humans, etc.), the authors might consider the following suggestions:
1. Clearly differentiate between purely computational research and studies involving humans directly or indirectly. For the latter, appropriate disclosures and approvals should be obtained and documented.
2. If future work involves human participants in any capacity (such as evaluation of algorithm outputs, user studies, crowdsourcing for dataset annotation, etc.), the authors should seek IRB approval or an equivalent ethical review based on the requirements of their country or institution. This ensures ethical standards are maintained, and participant welfare is prioritized.
3. Maintain transparency about the sources of the datasets used, explicitly stating any human involvement in their creation or preprocessing, and ensure adherence to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, respecting privacy and data protection norms.

In summary, the authors' response is consistent with the given guidelines and the content of the paper, which focuses on computational approaches to processing and analyzing image datasets without involving human research subjects.</span><br>Correctness Score: 1<br>--------------------------------------<br><h3> Post Submission Survey</h3><p><a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRIDkcXFbsOrR09j4qA1MlG4Rfir2lPD_u9YC4eqKBJ8tHkw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.463237339=TWV0YS1BbGJ1bTogTXVsdGktZG9tYWluIE1ldGEtRGF0YXNldCBmb3JGZXctU2hvdCBJbWFnZSBDbGFzc2lmaWNhdGlvbg=='>Click here to submit a post submission survey</a></p><br><br><br><br><br>
