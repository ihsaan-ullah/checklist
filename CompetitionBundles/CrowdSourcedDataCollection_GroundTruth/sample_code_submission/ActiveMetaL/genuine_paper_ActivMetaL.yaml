# This yaml file consists of ground truth score for your checklist answers.
# These ground truth scores are what you expect the LLM to score your answers.

# Available scores:
# - 0   -> the answer is not acceptable for the standard of NeurIPS papers, e.g. for limitations, answering "No, we did not discuss limitations”, or, if there are theorem contributions, “No, we have not provided the proofs" is not acceptable, even if this is true, and will receive a score 0
# - 0.5 -> the question was partially addressed or the answer was not well substantiated. Needs to be revised
# - 1   -> good in every respect, solid answer matching expectations for a NeurIPS accepted paper. A Yes with proper justification would correspond to that

# Note: 
# - a key in this file is quesiton number. You can have any number of questions between 1 and 15 (total questions = 15)
# - if a key e.g. 4 is missing, this means the LLM will not review your question # 4 in the checklist.

# File name:
# - file name should match the paper filename e.g. if your paper file name is `genuine_MetaAlbum.pdf`, your ground_truth file name should be `genuine_MetaAlbum.yaml`
