# Instructions

## Preparing submissions

As an authors of NeurIPS'24 papers, please follow the [CFP intructions](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers). For the purpose of making submissions on this platform, please use the [NeurIPS'24 LaTeX template](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2024/Styles.zip), which includes the paper checklist, at the bottom. Please **only submit papers of which you are a co-author.**

Fill out the checklist honestly and as correctly as possible. We welcome only genuine papers that are advanced draft versions of your NeurIPS'24 submissions. However, you may format some of your own papers submitted elsewhere in that format, and submit them, for test purposes, provided that you make best efforts to provide a good paper with a correctly answered checklist. See the Evaluation page for details on the score.

## Submitting

Zip the PDF of your paper and enter it via the **"My submissions" tab**. Avoid zipping the top directory.


## Viewing results

Once the submission has been processed, its score will appear, and the detailed feedback can be retrieved by clicking on the submission, then on the "VISUALIZATION" tab.
