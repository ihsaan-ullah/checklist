Feedback:
The paper introduces Meta-Album, a valuable and extensive meta-dataset tailored for few-shot learning, meta-learning, and cross-domain studies in image classification, positioning it as an essential resource for the research community. To strengthen the paper further, consider the following suggestions:

1. **Extended Evaluation and Applications**: While the paper provides a thorough introduction and overview of the Meta-Album meta-dataset, including its construction, preprocessing, and initial evaluations, future iterations could benefit from a more extensive exploration of its applications. Detailed case studies showcasing the dataset's use in cutting-edge few-shot learning models or novel meta-learning approaches could highlight its practical value and versatility. 

2. **Comparison with Similar Efforts**: Although the paper compares Meta-Album with other benchmarks and datasets, a deeper analysis focusing on the unique advantages of using Meta-Album for specific challenges in few-shot and cross-domain learning would strengthen its contribution. Specifically, it would be valuable to see empirical comparisons that demonstrate Meta-Album's superiority or notable differences in enhancing model generalizability across varied domains.

3. **Challenges and Limitations Discussion**: While the paper alludes to the potential challenges and limitations in preparing the datasets, a more in-depth discussion on this topic could offer valuable insights for researchers. For instance, addressing issues related to bias, variance in data quality across domains, and the scalability of curating and extending the Meta-Album meta-dataset would provide a more rounded view of its current and future capabilities.

4. **Availability and Accessibility**: The paper mentions that Meta-Album will be open for contributions and further extension. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the mechanisms in place to ensure the quality and diversity of future contributions. Additionally, discussing plans to make the dataset more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources could broaden its user base.

5. **Community Engagement and Feedback**: Finally, the paper could briefly outline a strategy for engaging with the broader research community to collect feedback, encourage contributions, and ensure the continual refinement and expansion of the dataset. Establishing a regular review process or organizing challenges and workshops could be potential avenues to explore.

By addressing these suggestions, the paper can significantly enhance the utility and appeal of the Meta-Album meta-dataset to a broader audience and ensure its long-term relevance and contribution to the field of machine learning.

Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?,Limitations,Yes,We have clearly explained the limitations of our work in Section: Discussion and conclusion,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. • The authors are encouraged to create a separate """" section in their paper. • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. . ",,
"For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?",Theoritical assumptions and proofs,Not Applicable,This does not apply to our research work because our research is not theoretical rather it deals with a meta-dataset creation and experiments executed using this meta-dataset,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced. • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. .

Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?,Error bars,Yes,"In figure-2, figure-3, Appendix E: Within Domain Few-shot learning, and Appendix F: Cross-Domain Few-shot learning, we have reported error bars","• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text. .

Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?,Impacts,Yes,"There are no negative societal impacts. Rather, this meta-dataset can foster progress in the fields of few-shot learning and meta-learning. We have added “recommended use” in Section 1.3.","• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML). .

"Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?",Safeguards,Yes,"Indeed, we are releasing our datasets with proper license and terms of use. We have also provided recommended usage of these datasets.","• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort. .
