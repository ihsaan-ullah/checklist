# Overview 


We provide a self-service verification assistant, for the NeurIPS 2024 checklist, found at the bottom of the [LaTex style file](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2024/Styles.zip).  See Instructions page to prepare your submission for verification.

**This is NOT the NeurIPS paper submission system. The authors should submit their paper to [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Conference) for review by NeurIPS, see [CFP](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers). This is not a product, this is an experimental service based on third party LLMs, provided as is, for benchmark purposes. See our terms and conditions, in the Terms tab.**

In this experimental setting, we aim at helping authors verify their checklist before submitting their paper. We only welcome 
- **genuine NeurIPS submissions**
- **author's own papers**
- **checklist filled with best effort**.
