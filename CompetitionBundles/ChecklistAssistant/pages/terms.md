# Terms and Conditions

**General terms:** The organizing team provides this service to assist authors with verifying the compliance of their paper with the NeurIPS 2024 checklist and conduct research on improving the NeurIPS checklist. It is based on a third party large language model (GPT-4 by OpenAI). The authors are advised that their paper will be sent to the API of OpenAI, and thus be treated under the conditions of confidentiality of OpenAI. To be eligible for participation, all authors must adhere to the stipulated terms and conditions. The organizers retain the right to make changes or additions to the terms and conditions at any time. This service is hosted by ChaLearn and Codabench and therefore it is governed by the [General ChaLearn Contest Rules](http://www.causality.inf.ethz.ch/GeneralChalearnContestRuleTerms.html) and the [terms of use of Codalab Competitions](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions/wiki/Privacy), and the other conditions set forth. The authors grant permission to the organizing team to analyze their submissions, but retain ownership of their submissions. 

**Registration and announcements:** Only one delegated author should make submissions on behalf of all co-authors. The delegated author must register to Codabench and provide a valid email address to receive announcements and be informed of any change in the rules. This email can be a group email shared by all co-authors. Announcements can also be made by email or via the Forum. The authors of multiple papers are requested to use a single account, or delegate another co-author. We forbid multiple accounts per person.

**Submissions:** The submissions are made via the Codabench platform. The entries must be formatted as specified on the Instructions page. The number of submissions per day and maximum total computational time are restrained and subject to change, according to the number of participants. Using multiple accounts to increase the number of submissions is NOT permitted. **Please be courteous with others and do not abuse the system by circumventing the quotas.** The participants are required to only submit papers that are their own and seek permission from their co-authors to do so. This service is not for use by third parties, including reviewers. **Please refrain from submitting papers that are not your own.** Any external links included in a paper submission are excluded from processing. The content generated by this service does not consider or analyze external links and should not be interpreted in connection with them. Thus the authors are invited to include in the main body of their paper or the attached appendix (included in the same submitted PDF) all relevant information to support the answers to the checklist questions.

**Anonymity:** The authors can elect to remain anonymous by using a pseudonym and submitting anonymized papers. **We recommend to only submit anonymized papers.** The paper scores and the LLM detailed feedback is available in "My Submissions" under the VISUALIZATION tab.

**Prizes and dissemination:** This service is for research and educational purposes only and no prizes are granted.

**Disclaimer:** This service aims to assist participants in writing good papers, it is not a substitute for the anyoneâ€™s critical thinking and expertise. This service is provided "as is", and the organizing team and the sponsors (including [NeurIPS](https://nips.cc) and [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/)) decline any express or implied warranties, and they are not liable for any direct or indirect consequential damages, including, but not limited to, errors in the evaluations or incorrect claims made, public exposure or loss of data, and interruption of service, however caused. This is NOT the NeurIPS paper submission system. The authors should submit their paper to OpenReview for review by NeurIPS. They are reminded to exercise their own discretion and judgment when utilizing this service and to adhere to all NeurIPS guidelines and policies when submitting their paper for review to NeurIPS 2024. 

**Contact:** The preferred means of communication is via the Forum. In case of problem, send email to [checklist@chalearn.org](mailto:checklist@chalearn.org).
