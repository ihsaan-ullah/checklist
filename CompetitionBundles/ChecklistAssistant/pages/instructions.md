# Instructions

## Preparing submissions

As an author of NeurIPS'24 paper, please follow the [CFP intructions](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers). For the purpose of making submissions on this platform, please use the [NeurIPS'24 LaTeX template](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2024/Styles.zip), which includes the paper checklist at the end of the paper, after references and all appendices. Please **only submit papers of which you are a co-author.**

Fill out the checklist honestly and as correctly as possible. We welcome only genuine papers that are advanced draft versions of your NeurIPS'24 submissions. However, you may format some of your own papers submitted elsewhere in that format, and submit them, for test purposes, provided that you make best efforts to provide a good paper with a correctly answered checklist.

## Submitting

Zip the PDF of your paper and enter it via the **"My submissions" tab**. Only zip the PDF file without the parent directory. Please do not include any other files in the zip except for a single PDF.
