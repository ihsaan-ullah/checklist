Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?,Claims,Yes,The abstract and introduction clearly state the main contributions and scope of the paper,"• The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. • The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. • The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. • It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. . ","The answer provided by the authors regarding the alignment of the main claims in the abstract and introduction with the paper's contributions and scope is consistent with the check of the provided paper content. The abstract and introduction sections accurately outline the contributions, including the introduction of the Meta-Album, a multi-domain meta-dataset designed for few-shot image classification tasks across varying domains. These claims are matched with the theoretical framework and experimental evaluations detailed in the subsequent sections of the paper. The introduction effectively sets the stage for the presented research, making it clear what the paper achieves and the scope of its contributions.

However, for a more critical analysis and considering the potential for even higher scrutiny, a few aspects could be further emphasized or clarified:

1. **Specificity on Novelty and Impact**: While the abstract and introduction do highlight the creation of Meta-Album and its utility in few-shot learning research, they could further articulate the specific aspects that distinguish this meta-dataset from existing datasets in terms of diversity, scale, and practical applicability. A clearer emphasis on how Meta-Album advances the current state-of-the-art in meta-learning and few-shot learning would strengthen the introductory claims.

2. **Limitations and Assumptions**: The introduction briefly touches upon the problem of limited data availability in certain domains and how Meta-Album seeks to address this. However, it could more explicitly discuss any assumptions made during the dataset compilation process and limitations encountered that could affect generalization or applicability in real-world scenarios.

3. **Clarification on Continuous Expansion**: While the paper states that Meta-Album is designed to be continually expanded, additional details on the process for integrating new datasets - including quality assurance, domain selection criteria, and how the community can contribute - would be valuable right from the beginning to set the expectations.

Actionable Suggestions:

- Include a paragraph in the introduction that more deeply discusses the novelty and specific contributions of Meta-Album in comparison to existing datasets.
- Clearly outline any limitations and assumptions in the early sections of the paper to set accurate expectations for the reader.
- Provide more detailed information on the continuous expansion plan for Meta-Album, possibly by adding a subsection in the methodology or discussion sections that covers community contributions and dataset integration processes.

Overall, the response to the review question is considered satisfactory, with room for improvement in detailing and clarifying the contributions and scope outlined in the abstract and introduction.",1
Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?,Limitations,No,We haven't clearly explained the limitations of our work in Section: Discussion and conclusion,"• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. • The authors are encouraged to create a separate """" section in their paper. • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. . ","Explanation: The authors indicated that they have not discussed the limitations of their work, which is inconsistent with comprehensive research reporting guidelines. Discussing limitations is fundamental to scientific integrity, offering transparency about the research's scope, applicability, and robustness. While the authors have acknowledged this oversight in their justification, it's critical to directly address it in the paper to provide a complete and honest scientific account.

Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:
1. Dedicate a section or a substantial paragraph in the ""Discussion and Conclusion"" to explicitly articulate the limitations of the study. This could include limitations regarding the dataset diversity, performance in real-world settings, computational requirements, or generalizability beyond the tested domains.
2. Reflect on the implications of these limitations for the practical application of Meta-Album and the derived insights for future work. For instance, if certain domains or image types are underrepresented, how might this influence the meta-dataset's utility in those areas?
3. Consider discussing how the scalability of the produced or analyzed methods might be influenced by dataset size, complexity, and domain diversity. Is there a computational bottleneck that could hinder application to larger datasets or real-time systems?
4. Explore any ethical considerations, such as privacy and fairness, particularly relevant if the datasets include human subjects or could be applied in sensitive contexts.
5. Include a forward-looking perspective on how identified limitations could be addressed in future studies or iterations of the Meta-Album project.
6. Involve a broader discussion on the robustness of the system against assumptions mentioned in the original work or potential biases within the meta-dataset itself.
7. Acknowledge any constraints in the evaluation methodology, such as reliance on specific performance metrics that might not capture all facets of few-shot learning or cross-domain adaptability.

By addressing these points, the authors not only adhere to research integrity norms but also enhance the paper's value for readers by providing a clearer understanding of the work's scope and potential impact.",0
"For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?",Theoritical assumptions and proofs,Not Applicable,Our work is not theoretical so this does not apply on our research,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. • All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and crossreferenced. • All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. • The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. • Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. • Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced. . ","The authors' response that the question is not applicable (NA) is consistent with the content of the paper. The paper focuses on introducing Meta-Album, a multi-domain meta-dataset designed for few-shot learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning tasks. The primary contributions are the creation of this dataset and its evaluation for few-shot learning tasks. There is no direct mention of theoretical results such as theorems or formulas that would require proofs.

However, for completeness and to address the guidelines more thoroughly:

1. It might be beneficial for future work or extensions of this paper to consider incorporating some theoretical insights or analysis, especially regarding the implications of cross-domain few-shot learning on model generalization and learning efficiency. Though not directly relevant to the current work, these could enrich the understanding of why certain approaches work better in the tested scenarios.

2. If the authors or future extensions of this work plan to delve into theoretical aspects, it is crucial to follow the guidelines mentioned, such as clearly stating all assumptions, numbering theorems, and providing complete proofs or sketches in the supplemental material.

3. Since this paper is more focused on the practical application and empirical evaluation of the introduced meta-dataset, the NA answer to the original question is justified. It's clear that the intent and contribution of the paper are well-aligned with presenting and validating a practical resource rather than exploring theoretical constructs.

In summary, the authors' response is appropriate given the scope and contributions of their paper. Their work on Meta-Album concentrates on empirical evaluations and does not delve into theoretical results that would necessitate proofs and formal assumptions.",1
Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?,Experiments reproducibility,Yes,We have made our code and data publicly available on our github repository and on our website,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer.

","Justification:
The justification provided in the answer does not adhere to the in-depth guidelines necessary to ensure comprehensive reproducibility and transparency of the experimental results. Merely stating that the code and data are publicly available does not fulfill the requirement for full disclosure under the provided guidelines. There is no mention of specific environmental needs, exact commands for running the experiments, access to raw and preprocessed data, or reproducibility of specific experiments compared to others. The lack of detailed methodological transparency and explicit reproducibility instructions could hinder other researchers' ability to fully replicate the study's results and conclusions. Additionally, there's no mention of whether instructions are provided for data preparation and accessing all experimental results, including the baseline methods.

Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:

1. **Detailed Documentation**: Provide a comprehensive README file or documentation that includes detailed instructions for replicating the experiments. This should cover the environment setup, including the specific versions of software and libraries required.

2. **Exact Commands**: Include the exact commands that need to be run to reproduce the experimental results, along with an explanation of what each command does. This is crucial for ensuring that other researchers can obtain the same results presented in the paper.

3. **Data Access and Preparation**: Clearly outline the process for accessing both the raw and preprocessed data. If any data preprocessing is required, provide scripts or step-by-step instructions for this process.

4. **Experiment Reproducibility**: Specify which experiments can be directly reproduced with the provided scripts and which cannot. For those that cannot, explain why and provide enough details so that they could be replicated manually if needed.

5. **Anonymized Code and Data Link**: If the paper is under review and anonymity is required, ensure that the links to the code and data are anonymized. Consider using platforms that allow for anonymous sharing during the peer-review process.

6. **Environmental Requirements**: Include a detailed description of the computational environment needed to replicate the experiments. This involves specifying the operating system, programming languages, and version numbers of all relevant software and libraries.

7. **Support and Updates**: Encourage users of the code and data to reach out with questions or issues and commit to maintaining the repository with updates or corrections as needed.

By addressing these suggestions, the authors can significantly improve the reproducibility of their research, allowing the wider research community to build upon their work more effectively.",0
"Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?",Code and data accessibility,Yes,We have made our code and data publicly available on our github repository and on our website,"• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer.

","The answer provided by the authors and the justification align well with the guidelines for providing open access to the data and code necessary to reproduce the main experimental results. According to the authors, they have made their code and data publicly available through their GitHub repository and project website, which is in compliance with the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines. This approach enhances the reproducibility of the research and allows other researchers to validate and build upon the work presented in the paper.

However, to further ensure the completeness and utility of the provided resources, I would recommend the authors to consider the following actionable items:

1. **Detailed Instructions**: Ensure that the GitHub repository and project website contain detailed instructions on how to set up the environment, access the data, and execute the code to reproduce the results presented in the paper. This should include any dependencies, required packages, and specific version numbers to prevent compatibility issues.

2. **Direct Links**: Provide direct links to the specific GitHub repository and project website within the paper or supplemental material if not already done. While preserving anonymity for submission, these can be updated post-review.

3. **Demonstration of Reproducibility**: It would be beneficial for the authors to demonstrate the reproducibility of their experimental results, possibly through a short video or a step-by-step guide that walks through the reproduction of key results. This can further increase confidence in the reproducibility of the work.

4. **Clarify What is Reproducible**: Clearly state which experimental results can be reproduced with the provided code and data. If any results are not reproducible due to proprietary data or other reasons, this should be explicitly mentioned, along with an explanation.

5. **License Information**: It is crucial to include license information for both the code and the dataset to inform users of how they can use, modify, and distribute the resources. This helps ensure that the materials are used ethically and legally.

By addressing these suggestions, the authors can significantly enhance the accessibility and reproducibility of their research, fostering further exploration and innovation in the field.",1
"Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?",Experimental settings/details,No,We have omitted many experimental details and hyper parameters,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. • The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material. . ","The answer and justification provided by the authors are not entirely consistent with the content of the paper. The paper does provide an extensive description of the Meta-Album dataset, including preprocessing steps, dataset versions (Micro, Mini, Extended), motivation behind the dataset's creation, and its intended use cases. Moreover, it details the experimental setup for evaluating few-shot learning algorithms, including the problem setting, the division of datasets into meta-splits, and the specific challenge setup. However, it is true that the paper could provide more explicit details on hyperparameters used, the type of optimizer, and other experimental settings for the algorithms evaluated.

Constructive and actionable suggestions:
1. **Hyperparameters and Optimizer Details**: Include a section or appendix detailing the hyperparameters used in the experiments for each algorithm tested, including learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs. Also, specify the type of optimizer used (e.g., SGD, Adam) for training, along with any specific reasons for these choices based on prior work or preliminary experiments.
2. **Data Splits and Distribution**: While the paper mentions the use of different sets for meta-training, meta-validation, and meta-testing, providing explicit details on the distribution of classes and images across these splits would enhance reproducibility. This includes specifying the number of classes and images per class in each split.
3. **Hardware and Software Configuration**: Include information about the computing environment used for experiments, such as GPU models, the version of deep learning libraries, and any relevant software dependencies. This helps in understanding the computational resources required and ensures reproducibility in similar environments.
4. **Baseline Methodologies Detailed Settings**: For the baseline methodologies evaluated in the paper, such as Prototypical Networks and MAML, describe any adaptations or modifications made to these methods specifically for your experiments. This could involve how the methods are tailored to handle the variety of domains or the specifics of the any-way any-shot setting.
5. **Supplemental Material Submission**: If space constraints limit the extent of detail that can be included in the main paper, consider submitting supplemental material with full experimental protocols, including code, detailed hyperparameters, data splits, and additional results. Making the code publicly available on platforms such as GitHub, along with a README file, can significantly enhance the paper's impact by allowing others to replicate and build upon your work directly.

Including these details will greatly improve the reproducibility of your results and enable other researchers to build upon your work more effectively.",0
Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?,Error bars,No,We haven't reported error bars for our experiments,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text. . ","Justification:
The authors' response to the question regarding reporting error bars and the statistical significance of the experiments is incorrect based on the extensive details provided in the paper content. The paper explicitly reports error bars and statistical significance in various sections detailing experimental results, contradicting the authors' answer. Specifically, the paper provides 95% confidence intervals for performance results across multiple tables (e.g., Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, and Table 8), clearly indicating the variability and statistical reliability of the findings. Furthermore, the error bars are based on per-task level calculations over a number of runs, showing a rigorous approach to capturing the variability factors like initialization and random sampling within the experiments. The method of calculation for these statistical measures is implied to be standard practice for confidence intervals within the field, aligned with the variability factors mentioned. The paper also distinguishes between different settings, such as cross-domain few-shot learning and any-way any-shot settings, further demonstrating a nuanced understanding of statistical evaluation in varied experimental conditions.

Constructive suggestions for improvement:
1. Clarify in the response about the reported error bars across the paper. Acknowledge the sections where 95% confidence intervals are provided and explain the significance of these statistics in supporting the paper's claims.
2. Explicitly state the factors of variability captured by the error bars in the experimental sections and how these contribute to the reliability of the results.
3. Include a paragraph in the methodology section detailing the statistical methods used for calculating error bars and confidence intervals, including any assumptions made. This will improve transparency and reproducibility.
4. Consider extending the statistical analysis by discussing the implications of the observed confidence intervals on the main claims of the paper. This could involve a deeper analysis of cases with wider confidence intervals and how they might affect the generalization of the results.
5. Lastly, review the entirety of the paper to ensure that all statistical measures reported in tables or figures are consistently and accurately discussed in the text, with clear references to how they support the research findings.",0
"For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?",Compute resources,No,We haven't provided details about compute resources used,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper). . ","The justification provided by the authors contradicts the detailed content of the paper. The paper does include information about the computing resources utilized for the experiments. Specifically, in Table 17, the paper presents detailed running times for all techniques in different cross-domain settings over all datasets, implicitly providing an insight into the computational resources necessary for reproducing the experiments.

However, to rigorously comply with the guidelines and enhance reproducibility, the paper could be improved by explicitly specifying:

1. **Type of Compute Workers**: Whether the experiments were run on CPUs or GPUs, the specific models of these processors, and whether these resources were accessed through an internal cluster or a cloud provider.

2. **Memory and Storage**: The amount of RAM and GPU memory (if applicable) used to run the experiments, alongside any storage requirements for dataset handling.

3. **Detailed Compute Requirements**: While running times are provided, additional clarity on the compute resources (number of CPUs/GPUs, types of GPUs, etc.) for each experiment would enhance reproducibility.

4. **Total Compute Estimation**: An estimation of the total compute in terms of GPU/CPU hours required for each experimental scenario, including any preprocessing steps.

5. **Disclosure on Total Project Compute**: Mention whether the reported experiments encompass the full extent of compute used in the research project, or if additional, unreported experiments required significant compute resources.

These actionable suggestions aim to fulfill the guidelines for disclosing computational resources, thereby improving the paper's clarity on experimental reproducibility.",0
"Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?",NeruIPS code of ethics,Yes,Our research is completely ethical and we conform to the NeurIPS code of ethics,"• The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. • If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. • The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction). . ","The given answer and justification provided by the authors do not seem sufficient to assess full adherence to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. A simple confirmation without detailed reasoning or evidence might not be enough to assure the reviewers and readers that all ethical aspects have been thoroughly considered and adhered to, especially considering the broad and significant implications outlined in the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:
1. **Detailed Ethical Consideration**: Provide a more detailed explanation of specific ethical considerations taken into account during your research. This might include aspects related to data collection, processing, and usage, especially considering privacy, consent, and potential biases in the datasets.

2. **Data Privacy and Consent**: If your research involved human participants (indirectly through dataset usage), clarify how consent was acquired or how existing datasets were vetted to ensure they were ethically sourced.

3. **Bias and Fairness Analysis**: Given the focus on image classification and the variety of domains your dataset encompasses, a discussion on steps taken to mitigate dataset biases would strengthen your adherence to ethical guidelines. Address how the diversity of data impacts algorithm fairness and what measures were taken to analyze and mitigate potential biases.

4. **Impact on Society**: Elaborate on the potential societal impact of your research and technology. Discuss both the positive applications and potential negative implications, if any. This includes considering the misuse of technology and steps taken to prevent it.

5. **Sustainability and Accessibility**: Reflect on the environmental impact of developing your meta-dataset and implementing the associated algorithms, given the computational resources required. Additionally, discuss the accessibility of your dataset for broader segments of the research community, including considerations for researchers with limited computational resources.

6. **Preserve Anonymity**: Ensure that any additional explanation or examples provided maintain the anonymity required by the review process.
   
By addressing these points, the authors can provide a more comprehensive and convincing justification that their research not only adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics but also actively contributes to ethical advancements in the field of AI and machine learning.",0
Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?,Impacts,No,We haven't discussed the limitations in detail,"• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML). . ","The justification provided by the authors indicates a misunderstanding or oversight regarding the NeurIPS Paper Checklist's question on societal impact. The response suggests that the authors have not discussed the limitations or potential societal impacts (positive or negative) in detail, which is a crucial aspect of responsible research dissemination. Discussing both positive and negative societal impacts is essential, even for foundational research, as it helps identify potential future applications and misuses of the technology developed.

Constructive and actionable suggestions:
1. **Reflect on Potential Applications**: The authors should carefully consider both direct and indirect applications of their work. Even if the research is foundational, there could be foreseeable applications that may have societal impacts. For instance, the development of a more diverse and larger meta-dataset for few-shot learning, as presented in the paper, could impact areas like surveillance, personalized content delivery, or automated decision-making, which have profound societal implications.
   
2. **Identify Unintended Uses and Misuses**: Given the nature of the dataset and the advancements in few-shot learning, the technology could potentially be used in ways that were not intended by the authors, including privacy invasions or deepfake generation. It is important to discuss such possible misuses and their implications.

3. **Consider Fairness and Accessibility**: Reflect on how the creation of this meta-dataset and the advancements in few-shot learning might impact fairness in machine learning models. Consider whether the data and methods are accessible to a wide range of researchers, including those from underrepresented regions, or if they could exacerbate existing inequalities in the field.

4. **Discuss Mitigation Strategies**: If potential negative impacts are identified, the authors should discuss strategies to mitigate these concerns. This could include recommendations for the ethical use of the dataset, suggestions for future research directions that prioritize ethical considerations, or technical solutions that could prevent misuse.

5. **Highlight Positive Impacts**: Conversely, the creation of such a diverse and extensive dataset could have significant positive societal impacts, such as advancing research in critical areas like healthcare, environmental monitoring, or education through improved few-shot learning models. These positive aspects should also be discussed to provide a balanced view.

By addressing these suggestions, the paper will not only comply with the NeurIPS guidelines but also contribute to a more responsible and forward-thinking discourse in the machine learning community.",0
"Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?",Safeguards,No,We haven't put any safeguards e.g. recommended use of datasets or license for datasets,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort. . ","The justification provided by the authors for not including safeguards in their data release process is inconsistent with the guidelines provided for responsible data release and usage. The presence of diverse datasets within Meta-Album, including datasets that have been collected from various sources and potentially include personally identifiable information or sensitive content, underscores the importance of establishing safeguards and ethical guidelines for data usage.

Constructive and actionable suggestions:

1. Implement Data Use Agreements (DUAs): Encourage users to adhere to specific usage guidelines by implementing DUAs that outline permissible and prohibited uses of the datasets. This can help mitigate misuse and specify ethical considerations.

2. Anonymization and Redaction: Undertake efforts to anonymize or redact any personally identifiable information present in the datasets to minimize privacy risks. This is particularly important for datasets involving human subjects.

3. Ethical Review and Datasets Curation: Conduct an ethical review of all datasets within Meta-Album, especially those sourced from the internet or containing potentially sensitive content. Curate and exclude any datasets that cannot be responsibly released following ethical standards.

4. Licensing: Clearly specify the licensing agreements for each dataset within Meta-Album. Use licenses that require users to agree to ethical conduct in data handling and application development.

5. Documentation and Transparency: Provide comprehensive documentation for each dataset, including its source, any preprocessing steps performed, and potential biases or sensitivities. Transparency around data collection and curation processes can inform responsible use.

6. Safeguards Against Biases: Acknowledge and address potential biases within the datasets. Providing guidelines or tools for identifying and mitigating biases in the datasets can promote more equitable research outcomes.

7. Reporting Mechanism: Establish a mechanism for users to report concerns or misuse related to the datasets. This could include issues related to privacy, ethics, or data integrity.

By addressing these points, the authors can significantly contribute to the responsible release and use of the Meta-Album data, aligning with broader community standards for ethical AI research and development.",0
"Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?",Credits,No,We are releasing the datasets without any proper license,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators. . ","The justification provided in the review does not align with the content provided in the paper. The paper meticulously documents the origin of each dataset included in the Meta-Album, crediting the creators or original owners appropriately. Furthermore, it mentions the verification of licenses and the provision of this information within the appendices, specifically Appendix B, which focuses on license information for all datasets within Meta-Album. This indicates a clear effort to respect and acknowledge the terms of use and licensing requirements of the utilized assets.

Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:
1. **Clarify Licensing in Main Text**: While the paper does an excellent job of acknowledging sources and checking licenses, explicitly mentioning the efforts to verify and respect license terms within the main text can enhance clarity. A brief statement on the overall licensing stance, especially the efforts made to ensure compliance with the original data licenses, would be beneficial.
   
2. **Direct Link to License Details**: Although Appendix B is mentioned for license details, providing a direct link or a more explicit reference within the main text to where these license details can be found (such as a specific URL if available) would improve accessibility and clarity for readers and reviewers.

3. **Explicit Mention of Meta-Album License**: If Meta-Album, as a compiled or extended dataset, has its own overarching license, explicitly stating this license in both the paper and accompanying documentation could help clear up any potential confusion regarding the terms under which Meta-Album itself can be used.

4. **Engagement with Original Data Creators**: For datasets where licensing information was not immediately available or clear, mentioning any efforts made to engage with the original creators for clarification could further demonstrate due diligence in respecting intellectual property rights.

These suggestions aim to strengthen the paper’s section on asset usage, licensing, and credit, ensuring that all efforts made by the authors in these areas are clearly communicated and easily verifiable by readers and future researchers.",0
Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?,Documentation,No,We haven't provided proper documentation fo our new datasets in the paper,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. . ","The justification provided by the authors is inconsistent with the content of the paper. The paper does indeed introduce Meta-Album, a new meta-dataset for few-shot learning, and provides extensive documentation and resources related to it. This includes detailed information about the source, preprocessing, licensing, and structure of the datasets included in Meta-Album. Moreover, the paper also mentions a website and a GitHub repository where the source code, data loaders, challenge-winning methods, and instructions for contributing datasets or algorithms are available.

However, it is worth noting that for an asset like Meta-Album, which is extensive and intended to be a growing resource, documentation and clarity regarding data provenance, usage limitations, consent for use, and licensing are critical. While the paper and associated resources provide a good foundation, there may be room for improvement in these areas. 

To address any potential gaps, the authors can consider the following suggestions:
1. **Enhanced Documentation:** Ensure that the documentation clearly covers every dataset included in Meta-Album, especially focusing on licensing, data provenance, and any specific limitations on the use of the datasets. This information should be easily accessible.
2. **Clarify Consent Procedures:** If not already done, document the procedures used to obtain consent for the use of datasets, especially those sourced from third parties or containing human subjects.
3. **License Information:** Clearly state the licensing information for each dataset and for Meta-Album as a whole, ensuring users are aware of how they can legally use the data.
4. **Update Guidelines for Contribution:** Provide detailed guidelines for contributors wishing to add datasets to Meta-Album. This should include requirements for documentation, licensing, and data quality.
5. **Accessibility:** Ensure that all provided links (e.g., to websites, GitHub repositories) are maintained and kept up to date, allowing easy access to Meta-Album's resources.

Overall, while the paper provides a significant contribution with the Meta-Album meta-dataset and accompanying documentation and resources, focusing on these suggestions can help enhance the clarity and utility of the assets introduced.",0
"For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?",Human subjects,Not Applicable,Our work is not related to any crowdsourcing experiments.,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. . ","The answer provided is consistent with the content presented in the paper. After reviewing the extensive details about the Meta-Album dataset and associated methodologies for creating and utilizing such a dataset for few-shot learning, it is clear that the research does not involve crowdsourcing experiments or direct research with human subjects. Therefore, the NA (not applicable) response to the question concerning the inclusion of instructions given to participants and details about compensation is justified and accurate. The focus of the paper is on the development and evaluation of a meta-dataset for image classification purposes, which primarily involves computational and algorithmic methodologies rather than direct human participation in the form of crowdsourced data collection or experiments.

Constructive and actionable suggestions are not necessary in this case as the answer correctly addresses the question based on the paper's content and scope. Nonetheless, it's always beneficial for future iterations or related works to reiterate the nature of research involvement with human subjects or the lack thereof clearly in the methodology section, ensuring transparency and adherence to ethical guidelines.",1
"Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?",Risks,Not Applicable,This does not apply to our research,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. • Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. • We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. • For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.","The justification provided by the authors is consistent with the content of the paper. The paper introduces Meta-Album, a meta-dataset for few-shot image classification, which consists of compiling and preprocessing various open datasets for facilitating research in cross-domain meta-learning. There is no direct involvement of human participants in the form of subjects contributing data or being part of an experimental study that could incur potential risks. Therefore, the question of disclosing risks to subjects or obtaining Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals does not apply in this context.

Constructive and actionable suggestions:
1. While the current response is appropriate for the given question, ensuring that this clarification is also accessible within the main content of the paper could aid in preemptively addressing any similar queries from readers or reviewers.
2. For future work involving human subjects, or if any ambiguity regarding human data arises, the paper should include a detailed ethics section discussing the potential impacts, measures taken to mitigate any risks, and the status of ethical review approvals.
3. In continuation of ethical transparency, if any third-party datasets used in the Meta-Album have their own ethical considerations or restrictions, it might be beneficial to briefly acknowledge this and confirm adherence to those conditions.",1
