# This yaml file consists of ground truth score for your checklist answers.
# These ground truth scores are what you expect the LLM to score your answers.

# Available scores:
# - 0   -> Your answer is wrong i.e. it is not consistent with the paper content
# - 0.5 -> Your answer is partially right i.e. either there is some mateiral missing in the paper or you could have answered this question better
# - 1   -> You are very sure about your answer and that it completely answer the checklist question

# Note: 
# - a key in this file is quesiton number. You can have any number of questions between 1 and 15 (total questions = 15)
# - if you a key e.g. 4 is missing, this means the LLM will not review your question # 4 in the checklist.

# File name:
# - file name should match the paper filename e.g. if your paper file name is `genuine_MetaAlbum.pdf`, your ground_truth file name should be `genuine_MetaAlbum.yaml`
