In preparing this checklist assistant, we received advice and help from many people. We are particularly grateful to the NeurIPS'24 organizers, including General Chair Amir Globerson, Senior Program Chair Danielle Belgrave and program co-chairs Cheng Zhang, Angela Fan, Jakub Tomczak, Ulrich Paquet, Babak Rahmani
for participating in brainstorming discussions and contributing to the design. We have also very early on received inputs and encouragements from Andrew McCallum of OpenReview and Anurag Acharya from Google Scholar. Several volunteers have contributed ideas and helped with various aspects for the assistant preparation, including Jeremiah Liu, Lisheng Sun, Paulo Henrique Couto, Michael Brenner, Neha Nayak Kennard, Adrien Pavao.
