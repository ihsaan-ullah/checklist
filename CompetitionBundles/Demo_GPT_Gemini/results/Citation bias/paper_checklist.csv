Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?,Limitations,Yes,"Yes, in the final section (Section 5)","• The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. • The authors are encouraged to create a separate ”” section in their paper. • The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. • The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. • The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. • The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. • If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. • While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community.

Despite the Answer being marked as ""NA"" with a Justification that ""There is no theory,"" the Paper clearly investigates a research question that revolves around the existence of citation bias within peer review processes, which implicitly relies on theoretical frameworks related to bias, scientific impact, and peer review mechanisms. This incongruity suggests a discrepancy in how the authors perceive the theoretical grounding of their work. 

### Actionable Feedback:
1. **Clarification of Theoretical Basis:**
   - Revise the ""Answer"" to reflect the implicit theoretical investigations concerning citation bias. This adjustment would acknowledge the theoretical implications and frameworks that underlie the study's research questions and findings.

Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?,Experiments reproducibility,Yes,In Section 3.,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. • If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. • Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. • While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example (a) If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. (b) If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. (c) If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). (d) We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results. ","The proposed answers and justifications given by the authors suggest a favorable attempt towards transparency and reproducibility of experimental results. However, there are a few discrepancies when cross-checked with the content of the paper and the guidelines provided for ensuring reproducibility.

1. **Detailing of Methodology:** The paper provides an extensive outline of the experimental procedure, methodology, and the analytical approach used for investigating citation bias in peer review, which is commendable. However, it falls short in providing specific details regarding the experimental settings (e.g., version numbers of software tools, exact parameters used in the algorithms, and clear instructions on the preprocessing of data).

2. **Data Availability:** While the paper discusses the execution of an observational study and its analysis, it does not explicitly mention the availability of the data used for conducting these analyses. For reproducing the research findings, access to this data or detailed information on how to construct or obtain a similar dataset is crucial.

3. **Code Accessibility:** Despite the paper's extensive methodological clarity, no explicit mention is made regarding the availability of the code that underpins the analyses presented. For true reproducibility, the authors should provide the code or outlines to replicate the analysis, including any algorithms developed and statistical tests conducted.

### Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Provide Detailed Experimental Settings:**
   - Include exact version numbers for all software used.
   - Offer a more detailed account of the experimental parameters and settings.
   - Ensure that all pre-processing steps are clearly documented, allowing readers to replicate the experimental setup precisely.

2. **Clarify Data Availability:**
   - If possible, provide the dataset used for analysis in a public repository or supplement the paper with details on how the dataset can be constructed or accessed.
   - If there are privacy or ethical concerns with sharing the data, a simulated dataset that has similar characteristics should be provided along with the generation script.

3. **Release Code for Analysis:**
   - Deposit the codebase used for the analysis in a public code repository (e.g., GitHub, Bitbucket) and include the link in the paper.
   - Ensure the code is well-documented, with comments and a README file explaining how to execute the scripts to reproduce the findings.

4. **Supplement with Additional Resources:**
   - If feasible, provide an appendix or supplementary material including more detailed statistical analyses, additional figures supporting key findings, and a FAQ section addressing potential questions regarding reproducibility.

By addressing these recommendations, the authors can significantly enhance the reproducibility and transparency of their research, bolstering its contribution to the scientific community.

However, the peer review data is extremely sensitive and we do not have permissions from the participants nor from the IRB to release anything except the aggregate statistics.","• The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. • Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/ public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. • While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). • The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https: //nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. • The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. • The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. • At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). • Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted. ","The authors' answer and justification indicate they have provided a thorough description of the experimental procedure, allowing for the reproduction of the experiment but do not offer access to sensitive peer review data except for aggregate statistics due to privacy concerns. This response aligns somewhat with NeurIPS guidelines which understand that not all papers can provide open access to data and code if it's not possible. However, the expectation outlined in the guidelines for papers that do include experiments requiring code is to provide as much information as possible to ensure reproducibility, including detailed instructions, data access, and preparation, even if the data itself cannot be shared.

Notable discrepancies and areas for improvement:
1. **Missing Detailed Instructions for Reproduction**: While the authors have detailed their experimental procedure, it is not clear if they provided the specific commands or environment setups needed for replication. Providing a pseudocode or a more detailed methodology could improve reproducibility.

2. **Scripts for Reproducing Results**: The authors did not mention if scripts for reproducing experimental results, especially for the statistical analysis, are provided. Offering anonymized scripts or code frameworks would enhance transparency and allow others to validate or build upon the work more easily.

3. **Clarification on Data Accessibility**: Although sensitive data cannot be shared, the authors could improve by identifying specific data types used and suggesting potential approaches for interested researchers to obtain or simulate similar datasets. They should clearly state which results are reproducible with the provided instructions and which are not due to data privacy concerns.

4. **Details on Anonymized Versions**: For the sensitive data that cannot be shared, the authors could consider providing anonymized versions of the data or synthetic datasets that mirror the essential characteristics of the original data. This approach could help in balancing transparency and privacy concerns.

5. **Supplemental Material for Reproducibility**: The paper could be improved by including more comprehensive supplemental material that covers any workarounds or methodologies for dealing with the inability to share sensitive data. This may include detailed statistical models, parameters, and assumptions that are critical for understanding the experimental setup and outcomes.

Actionable feedback to improve paper quality:
- Provide a detailed appendix or supplemental materials containing pseudocode, environment setup, and execution steps for replicating the research.
- Share anonymized or synthetic versions of the data where possible, with a clear explanation of how these versions compare to the original datasets.
- Offer scripts or code in a public repository (with anonymization as needed) for reproducing the main results or analyses, explicitly stating any limitations.
- Include a detailed methodology for interested researchers to approximate or simulate the sensitive data used in the study.
- Enhance the supplemental material with detailed statistical models, including parameters and assumptions, to enable replication attempts of the analysis.

","The authors claim that their paper does not involve any ML model training or testing, thus marking the question regarding the specification of training and test details as not applicable (NA). However, upon reviewing the paper's content, it's evident that this paper does indeed not involve any traditional machine learning experiments or the development of an ML model where specifying training and testing details like hyperparameters, data splits, or optimizer types would be relevant. The work is an observational study on citation bias in peer review processes across two conferences, leveraging data analysis techniques without the direct application or development of ML models. Thus, the NA answer is aligned with the paper's focus and methodology.

However, to ensure the paper's experimental approaches and data analyses are thoroughly understood and transparent, enhancing the quality of the submission could involve:

1. Clarifying the experimental and data analysis methodologies used more explicitly, even if they do not involve traditional ML approaches. It's helpful to detail the specific observational and statistical methods employed, including any software or tools used for analysis. For instance, discussing how confounding factors were accounted for and the models used for statistical inference could substitute for the lack of ML training/test details.

2. Offering details on data collection procedures, even if there's no conventional data splitting. Explicitly stating the criteria for including particular papers and reviewers in the study would improve transparency. Discussing measures taken to ensure the reliability and validity of the data used in analyses can enhance the paper's credibility.

3. Describing any ethical considerations or IRB approvals involved in conducting the study, especially since real peer review data from conferences was utilized. This aspect is crucial for research integrity and should be clearly outlined.

4. Providing access to or detailed descriptions of any supplemental materials, codes, or datasets (if possible, considering anonymity and privacy concerns) that support the paper's findings. This practice aligns with the increasing emphasis on reproducibility and open science, even in observational studies.

5. Elaborating on limitations and biases potentially present in the observational study approach itself. While the paper does discuss confounding factors, a more comprehensive discussion on limitations could add to the transparency and robustness of the paper.

Conclusion: The NA answer to the specified question is justified given the paper's nature. However, bolstering the clarity and depth of methodological, ethical, and data-related details can significantly enhance understanding and trust in the findings presented.

Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?,Error bars,Yes,Section 4,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The authors should answer ”Yes” if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. • The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). • The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) • The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). • It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. • It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. • For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). • If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text. ","The proposed author's answer indicates that the paper does report error bars or other appropriate statistical significance information correctly. The justification provided references Section 4 without elaborating on how error bars are defined, what factors of variability they capture, or the method for calculating these error bars. Based on the provided guidelines, several key elements seem to be missing from the justification, assuming the actual content in Section 4 does not address these crucial details.

Itemized, actionable feedback aiming to improve the paper quality includes:

1. **Clarify Factors of Variability**: Explicitly state what factors of variability the error bars are capturing (e.g., train/test split, initialization). This clarification helps readers understand the source of the statistical variation being reported.
   
2. **Methodology for Calculating Error Bars**: Describe in detail how the error bars were calculated. Whether it's through a closed-form formula, a library function, or bootstrap methods, this explanation is crucial for reproducibility and validity of the statistical analysis.

3. **Specify Error Bar Type**: Clearly indicate whether the error bars represent the standard deviation, the standard error of the mean, or another measure. If reporting 1-sigma or 2-sigma error bars, explicitly state this choice.

4. **Address Assumptions Made**: List any assumptions made during the statistical analysis (e.g., assuming normally distributed errors). This transparency is critical for evaluating the appropriateness of the statistical tests used.

5. **Explain Asymmetric Distribution Measures**: For data with asymmetric distributions, ensure that error bars presented are also asymmetric if relevant. Symmetric error bars could be misleading for such distributions.

6. **Enhance Text References to Statistical Figures**: If error bars or statistical significance tests are mentioned in figures or tables, make sure these are discussed and explained in the text. Reference the specific figures or tables to guide readers.

By addressing these points, the paper can offer a more robust and transparent statistical analysis, which is fundamental for assessing the reliability of the experimental results.

**Conclusion and Score**:
The issues identified regarding the reporting and justification of error bars suggest there are critical elements of statistical reporting not fully addressed or clarified based on the information provided. Addressing these points is essential to ensure the paper meets the scientific standards required by the NeurIPS conference. Therefore,

"For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?",Compute resources,Not Applicable,Not applicable. We do not have experiments that depend on compute.,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. • The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. • The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. • The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper). ","The proposed author's answer and justification to the checklist question regarding the computer resources for reproducing the experiments indicate a discrepancy with the actual content of the paper. The paper explicitly describes an experimental investigation into citation bias within peer review processes, which inherently requires computational analysis of data collected from the review processes of two flagship conferences. This involves data management, potentially some level of automation for data parsing (to identify the citation relations and review scores), and statistical analysis to test the hypothesis regarding citation bias. Though not traditional 'experiments' involving physical or simulation models, these are empirical analyses requiring computing resources.

**Feedback:**

1. Clarify the nature of ""experiments"" mentioned in the study to accommodate the broad definition that includes observational studies and data analysis, highlighting that while they might not be conventional experiments, they still require computational resources.
   
2. Provide explicit details of the computational environment used for the analysis, including type of computers (CPU/GPU), memory specifications, and any specific software or programming languages utilized. If the analysis was performed on personal computers or using institutional servers, specify this information to assess reproducibility.

3. Estimate and report the computational time taken for executing the data analyses. This would include data preparation, parsing for citation relationship identification, and statistical analysis time. If different analyses took varying amounts of time, provide a breakdown.

4. If cloud computing services were leveraged, specify the provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and the configuration of the virtual machines used. Also, include information on the cost, if possible, to give an idea about the financial resources required.

5. Disclose any part of the research project that required significantly more computational resources than reported in the paper. This would include any preliminary analyses or failed experiments not included in the final submission to maintain transparency regarding the computational cost of the study.

","The proposed answer and justification provided by the authors claim full compliance with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics without substantiating details or the rationale behind their compliance assertion. Given the Guidelines provided for this question, several discrepancies and areas lacking detailed consideration emerge when the actual content of the paper is reviewed. The authors’ broad statement lacks depth and fails to address specific ethical considerations relevant to their research, especially regarding the implications of their findings on the fairness and integrity of the academic review process.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1. **Detailed Ethical Analysis:** The authors need to elaborate on how their research, particularly the findings related to citation bias, aligns with the ethical standards set by NeurIPS. This includes discussing any potential ethical ramifications their findings may have on the peer-review process and on the perceived integrity of scientific publications.
   
2. **Impact on Stakeholders:** An in-depth discussion on how the findings might influence the behavior of authors, reviewers, and conference organizers should be included. This should specifically address whether the behavior encouraged or discouraged by the findings promotes fairness, equity, and transparency in the scientific community.

3. **Data Privacy and Consent:** Given the observational study involves data from reviewers and papers, the authors must clarify how privacy was preserved, ensuring that data used in the study were anonymized and handled in a manner compliant with privacy regulations. If not directly mentioned in the paper, they should update it to reflect these aspects prominently.

4. **Consideration of Bias and Manipulation:** The paper should address how the study's findings around citation bias could be misused or could inadvertently promote unethical practices (e.g., strategic citations) among authors seeking to game the peer-review system. The authors should discuss safeguarding measures or recommendations to mitigate such risks.

5. **Transparency and Reproducibility:** The authors should verify that their methodology, data handling, and analysis are transparently reported in the paper, facilitating reproducibility and critical examination by the community.

6. **Discussion of Ethical Guidelines Compliance:** The authors need to add a section that explicitly discusses how their research complies with each aspect of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, including any relevant aspects related to manipulation, bias, fairness, and the responsible use of AI technologies (if applicable).

7. **Reviewer Impact and Response:** Since the research directly involves the peer-review process, a reflection on how the findings were perceived by the reviewer community involved in the study should be discussed, including any feedback or concerns raised.

Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?,Impacts,Yes,"Yes, in section 5","• The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. • If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. • Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. • The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. • The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. • If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML). ","The authors claim to have discussed both the potential positive and negative societal impacts of their work in Section 5. However, upon detailed review, several discrepancies and areas for improvement are found regarding the completeness and depth of their analysis against the guidelines provided. The actionable feedback focuses on enhancing the discussion of societal impacts in accordance with the specified guidelines:

1. **Clarify Direct and Indirect Societal Impacts:**
  - The paper should more explicitly distinguish between direct and indirect societal impacts of citation bias in peer review processes. Given the topic's relevance to fairness and integrity in scientific communication, it is important to elucidate how these biases might differently affect various stakeholders (e.g., authors, reviewers, and the scientific community at large).

2. **Expand on Negative Societal Impacts:**
  - The paper needs to deepen the discussion on negative societal impacts, specifically concerning fairness considerations. The authors should explore the broader implications of citation bias, such as reinforcing existing disparities in scientific recognition and resource allocation. Additionally, potential for misuse, such as strategical citation manipulation, should be addressed more comprehensively.
  - The authors should also consider discussing mitigation strategies for the highlighted negative impacts, offering a balanced view on potential solutions.

3. **Include Examples of Unintended Uses and Misuse:**
  - The document lacks specific scenarios illustrating how citation bias could lead to malicious or unintended uses. Examples pertaining to the generation of disinformation or ethical concerns around surveillance (when applicable) could enrich the discussion, making the societal implications more tangible for readers.

4. **Discuss Harms from Intentional and Unintentional Misuse:**
  - A critical reflection on harms that could arise both when the technology functions as intended and when it malfunctions or is misused intentionally should be integrated. This should include a nuanced discussion on the ethical dimensions of exploiting citation biases for personal or institutional gain.

5. **Propose Mechanisms for Monitoring and Mitigation:**
  - The paper should propose specific mechanisms for monitoring citation practices and mitigating negative impacts. Although foundational research might seem distant from practical applications, suggesting potential policy changes or technological tools for detecting citation manipulation would enhance the paper’s relevance and practical value.

6. **Reflect on the Role of the Research Community:**
  - The authors should reflect on the collective responsibility of the research community in addressing citation bias. This includes considering how peer review policies might evolve to prevent such biases from affecting review outcomes and scientific discourse more broadly.

By addressing these issues, the paper could offer a more comprehensive and balanced view of the societal implications associated with citation bias in peer review, aligning better with the guidelines for discussing societal impacts.

"Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?",Safeguards,Not Applicable,There is no release of any data or models.,"• The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. • Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. • Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. • We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort. ","The author's answer and justification upon examination show a discrepancy with the actual content of the paper. The paper discusses an observational study within the context of peer review, specifically exploring the influence of citation bias on reviewer scores. While the author's answer to the checklist question suggests there are no data or models being released, strictly interpreting this as not applicable (""NA"") only considers a narrow interpretation of data or model release.

The investigation presented in the paper inherently involves the analysis of peer review data, which, although not directly released, is scrutinized for patterns and results are published based on the analysis. The potential for misuse or ethical considerations around the analysis and presentation of this data seems not fully addressed, given the nuances of the observational study's impact on individuals' perceptions of fairness and bias within academic publishing.

Feedback to improve the paper:

1. Clarification: The authors should clarify their interpretation of ""release"" in the context of their study. They should discuss the safeguarding of the data used in their observational study, even if it's not ""released"" in a traditional sense. This includes anonymization of data, ethical considerations around the use of peer review data, and any permissions obtained for using such data.

2. Ethical Considerations: Elaborate on any ethical considerations taken during the study, especially given the potential implications of the findings on perceptions of bias and fairness in peer review. This might include how the study was designed to minimize any harm or bias, the consent process for using reviewer and paper data, and any IRB approval if applicable.

3. Data Security: Discuss measures taken to ensure the security and confidentiality of the peer review data analyzed. This could include data handling protocols, storage information, and access controls during the study.

4. Broader Implications: Reflect on the broader implications of the findings for the academic community and how the study's insights should be applied responsibly. This might also involve recommendations for future handling, presentation, and analysis of similarly sensitive data.

Overall, the paper would benefit from a broader discussion of the responsible use and analysis of sensitive academic data, acknowledging the potential for misuse or misinterpretation of research findings based on peer review behaviors.

"Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?",Credits,Yes,We have used algorithms such as TPMS and PeerReview4All. We have cited,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. • The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. • The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. • The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. • For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. • If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. • For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. • If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators. ","Given your inquiry, there are a few discrepancies or areas that need clarification based on the provided “Paper” and details on how the ""Answer"" and ""Justification"" align with the actual content. Below is an itemized, actionable feedback list:

1. **Citation and License Details**: Ensure all utilized algorithms like TPMS and PeerReview4All are not only cited but also include explicit mentions of their licenses if they are publicly available tools or datasets. The current justification mentions citation but lacks clarity on licenses and terms of use, which is crucial per the guidelines.

2. **Version and URL Inclusion**: For the assets used, including specific version numbers and URLs directly within the paper will strengthen the compliance with the guidelines. It’s not clear from the justification whether this was done comprehensively. For future enhancements, make sure each used asset (code, data, models) includes a version identifier and a URL where it can be found.

3. **Detailed License Information**: The justification skips over the specifics of the licensing terms for the mentioned assets. According to the guidelines, it is not sufficient to merely cite the use of such assets—detailed license information (e.g., “CC-BY 4.0”) must be explicitly stated in the document to ensure that terms of use are properly respected and communicated.

4. **Data Source Copyright Terms**: If any data were scraped or reused from a website or another paper, ensure the paper explicitly discusses the copyright situation and terms of service of these sources. It’s an aspect not covered in the justification provided and needs rectification if applicable to any of the paper's content.

5. **Repackaged Datasets**: In the event that existing datasets were re-packaged or modified for this study, the paper must discuss both the original license and the license of the newly derived asset. The provided justification lacks this detail.

6. **Communication with Asset Creators**: If there was any ambiguity regarding the use of certain assets or their licensing terms, the paper should elaborate on any efforts made to reach out to the asset's original creators for clarification. This would include email communications or permissions obtained, which seem to be absent in the justification provided.

7. **Figures, Tables, and Appendices**: Aside from algorithms and datasets, if any figures, tables, or supplementary material derived from external sources were used, ensure these are also properly credited with explicit mentions of their licensing as per the detailed guidelines for asset usage and acknowledgment.

**Actionable Steps**:
- Review each section of the paper where external assets are mentioned or utilized.
- Add explicit license information for each cited asset directly in the text or in a dedicated section for licenses and acknowledgments.
- Include version details and URLs for all tools, datasets, or codebases cited.
- For any repackaged datasets, ensure both the original and new licenses are clearly stated.
- Document any correspondence with original creators regarding asset use and licensing, if applicable.

Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?,Documentation,Not Applicable,No new assets,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. • Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. • The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. • At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. ","Upon reviewing the ""Answer"" and ""Justification"" provided by the authors in relation to the documentation of new assets introduced in the paper alongside the actual content of the paper titled ""Cite-seeing and Reviewing: A Study on Citation Bias in Peer Review,"" it is evident there are discrepancies when matched against the provided ""Guidelines"".

1. **Misclassification of the Response**: The authors have marked their response to the checklist question regarding the introduction of new assets as ""NA"" with the justification of ""No new assets"". However, this general claim seems to disregard the detailed observational study, methods, and experimental data that, while may not be a traditional dataset or software code, could be considered a substantial intellectual asset requiring detailed documentation, especially in terms of reproducibility and transparency of the methodological framework used in their analysis.

2. **Lack of Clarity on Consent and Anonymization**: Given the nature of the study involving peer reviews and citation practices in highly respected conferences, it is crucial to document whether and how consent was obtained from participants (if identifiable data were used) or how data were anonymized, to ensure ethically sound handling of potentially sensitive information.

3. **Methodological Transparency and Accessibility**: Although the paper provides an extensive account of the methodology and findings, the ""Guidelines"" explicitly encourage the inclusion of structured templates detailing datasets, code, models, training procedures, etc. This implication suggests that the authors should offer additional documentation or supplementary material that outlines the observational data analysis procedure, algorithms or code used for matching reviewers and submissions, and potentially any instruction that allows for the replication of the study findings.

**Actionable Feedback**:
- **Clarification and Documentation**: Authors should consider detailing the nature and scope of the assets created as part of their research, including the design and execution of the observational study, and any analytical tools or codes developed for the analysis. If the study's methodology and data can be shared without breaching confidentiality agreements with the conferences involved, doing so could enhance the submission's value.
- **Consent and Anonymization Details**: It's critical to provide explicit details on how ethical considerations, especially around consent and anonymization, were managed in the study design and execution phases.
- **Supplementary Materials**: Providing supplementary materials or a separate documentation file outlining the exact methodological steps, including data collection, analysis algorithms, and even pseudocode or actual code, could significantly improve the paper's reproducibility and adherence to the submission guidelines regarding new assets.
- **Clarification on Asset Definition**: A brief discussion or statement acknowledging why the authors believe no ""new assets"" were created as part of the study, underlining the definition of assets in the context of their work, could clarify the initial ""NA"" response and align it with the submission guidelines.

"For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?",Human subjects,Not Applicable,No crowdsourcing. The experiment was on observational data.,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. • Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. • According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. ","The proposed ""Answer"" to the checklist question seems accurate based on the extensive details provided in the paper. Given the experimental design and data analysis involving citation bias in peer review, with a focus on detecting citation bias through an observational study that integrates with the review process of two conferences (ICML 2020 and EC 2021), no explicit involvement of crowdsourcing experiments or research with human subjects in the conventional sense (e.g., surveys, behavioral experiments) is mentioned. Therefore, the requirements to provide full text of instructions to participants, screenshots, or details about compensation do not directly apply to the nature of this study.

**Feedback**

1. **Clarification on Human Subjects Involvement**: Even though the study focuses on observational data from peer review processes, involving reviewers and their evaluations, it might still be essential to clarify the boundary of ""human subjects research"" as understood in this context. Given that the research question revolves around the potential biases of reviewers (who are human subjects) based on their citation presence in the papers they review, an explicit statement regarding ethical considerations, even if to confirm exemption, would strengthen the submission.

2. **Transparency on Data Collection and Processing**: Detailed methodologies on how data (scores, citation indicators, etc.) were collected, processed, and anonymized should be elaborated. Given the sensitivity and confidentiality associated with peer review, ensuring that the identities of reviewers and authors are protected is crucial. This clarification can help address potential concerns about privacy and ethical research conduct.

3. **Broader Ethical Implications**: Although the study does not involve direct interaction with human subjects in the traditional sense (e.g., through surveys or experiments requiring informed consent), it deals with behaviors and biases in academic peer review. It would enhance the paper's integrity to discuss the broader ethical implications of the findings and how they might influence the perception and conduct of peer reviewers and authors within the scientific community.

4. **Engagement with Reviewer Pool**: If any form of direct or indirect engagement occurred with the reviewer pool (e.g., post-study disclosure, feedback collection on the study's premise or findings), this should be disclosed. Such engagement, even if minimal, could require ethical oversight or at least acknowledgement in the paper.

**Conclusion**

The paper meticulously applies observational data to explore citation bias in peer review without direct human subject interaction in a traditional experimental setup. However, expanding on ethical considerations, data handling transparency, and the broader implications of the study's findings on the human subjects involved (i.e., peer reviewers) would enhance its quality and adherence to ethical guidelines.

"Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?",Risks,Yes,We got IRB approval as mentioned in the Acknowledgments.,"• The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. • Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. • We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. • For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.","Based on the information presented, there are several discrepancies between the authors' response to the checklist question regarding the description of potential risks to study participants and the actual content of the paper. Specifically, the paper discusses the use of human subjects in a study on citation bias within peer review processes at two academic conferences, which inherently involves human participation and could lead to ethical concerns such as privacy, consent, and potential reputational harm. However, the authors' justification for their answer suggests that simply having IRB approval mentioned in the acknowledgments secures ethical clearance and suffices for ethical disclosure within the paper itself. This assertion may not fully align with the comprehensive ethical overview expected, as per the guidelines provided. 

Itemized, actionable feedback:

1. **Clarify the Scope of IRB Approval:** Ensure that the text specifies the scope of the IRB approval - does it cover all aspects of handling personal data, consent processes, and potential impacts on the participants? If the IRB approval encompasses all ethical concerns related to human subjects in this study, provide a brief summary of these considerations in the main text, not just in the acknowledgments.

2. **Disclose Potential Risks and Mitigations Explicitly:** Given that the study involves analyzing the behavior of reviewers in a peer-review process, it's crucial to describe any potential risks to these participants explicitly in the paper. These could include risks to confidentiality, risks of coercion, or any other ethical concerns identified by the IRB. Additionally, describe the measures taken to mitigate these risks.

3. **Consent Process:** Clearly describe how consent was obtained from the study's participants. Was the participation voluntary? Were the participants informed about the study's purpose, its potential risks and benefits, and their right to withdraw? This information is crucial for a comprehensive ethical overview.

4. **Data Anonymization and Privacy:** Given the sensitive nature of peer review data, provide a detailed description of how the data was anonymized and protected during and after the study. This includes any measures taken to ensure that individual reviewers cannot be identified through the study's findings.

5. **Impact of the Study on Participants:** Discuss any potential impact the study's findings might have on the participants, especially if the findings could influence perceptions of fairness in academic evaluations. If any, clarify how these impacts are addressed or mitigated.

By addressing these points, the paper will provide a more comprehensive treatment of the ethical implications involved in research with human subjects, as per the NeurIPS guidelines. This is crucial not only for ethical rigor but also for maintaining the trustworthiness of the research process and its findings.
