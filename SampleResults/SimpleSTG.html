Additionally, detail the sources of variability in your experiments, whether those come from different train/test splits, initialization procedures, or any stochastic elements of the models or training process.<br><br>3. Detailed Statistics: When reporting error bars, specify whether they represent one standard deviation (1-sigma), two standard deviations (2-sigma), standard error of the mean, or another measure. This detail is crucial for readers to accurately interpret the significance and reliability of the results.<br><br>4. Explanation of Symmetry/Asymmetry in Error Bars: If the distribution of results is not symmetric, consider reporting confidence intervals or median with interquartile ranges instead of mean with standard deviation/error.

Address Possible Negative Impacts: The paper should consider discussing potential risks associated with the deployment of advanced traffic prediction models. For instance, the misuse of traffic data and predictions could lead to privacy concerns or the unfair targeting of specific areas or populations. The authors should reflect on how their work could be misused or lead to unintended consequences.<br><br>3. Consider Fairness and Bias: The authors should assess if their proposed methods could inadvertently perpetuate or exacerbate biases present in traffic prediction data. This includes examining whether the model's predictions are equitable across different geographic areas and demographically diverse populations.<br><br>4. Privacy Considerations: Given that traffic prediction models often rely on collecting and analyzing large volumes of data, the authors should discuss privacy implications and how they plan to ensure the responsible use and protection of data.<br><br>5. Mitigation Strategies: If the paper identifies potential negative societal impacts, the authors should propose mitigation strategies. This could include recommendations for policymakers, suggestions for ethical guidelines in deploying such models, or technical solutions to prevent misuse.<br><br>6.

The paper introduces a novel framework for "Understanding and Simplifying Architecture Search in Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks," along with conducting comprehensive experiments to derive certain principles for designing STGNN architectures. Moreover, it presents a simplified method, termed "SimpleSTG," for searching better STGNN models. It's mentioned explicitly that the code related to this research is made available on GitHub, which constitutes the release of new assets. Therefore, stating that the paper does not release new assets is not accurate.<br><br>Suggestions:<br>1. The review should acknowledge the introduction of new assets, specifically the "SimpleSTG" method and the associated code on GitHub.<br>2. The review should assess the documentation provided for these assets. Considerations should include whether the GitHub repository contains a README file with details on how to use the code, the requirements (e.g., library versions), example scripts, and any notes on the architecture or the experimental setup that would help in reproducing or building upon the work.<br>3. If the paper lacks detailed explanation or documentation on the assets' use, applicability, limitations, and how consent was obtained (if applicable), these should be highlighted as areas for improvement. For instance, the paper could be asked to include a discussion on the potential limitations of the proposed "SimpleSTG" method or details on the datasets' licenses.<br>4. Suggest that authors ensure the provided GitHub link is accessible and anonymized if required by the submission guidelines. They should also ensure the repository remains available and maintains anonymity until the review process is concluded.<br><br>By addressing these aspects, the review will provide a thorough and critical assessment of the documentation and release of new assets as per the guidelines provided.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 14: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: NA</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.</span><br><span style='color:#0000FF;'>Review: The response provided by the authors is consistent with the content of the paper. Upon reviewing the paper's abstract, introduction, methodology, experiments, and conclusions sections, there is no mention or indication that crowdsourcing experiments or research involving direct human subjects were conducted. Instead, the focus of the research is on understanding and simplifying the architecture search of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) for multivariate spatio-temporal forecasting tasks, such as traffic prediction, which does not inherently require human subject studies or crowdsourcing experiments.<br><br>Given this context, marking the question as "NA" (Not Applicable) is accurate and correct. Since the paper's methodologies and experiments are centered around computational models and algorithmic development without direct human participation, there is no need for the inclusion of instructions given to participants, screenshots of the experiments involving humans, or details about compensation, as none of these apply to the work presented in the paper.<br><br>Suggestions for Improvement:<br>1. None - The authors' handling of this question is appropriate given the nature of their research. Their work does not involve crowdsourcing or human subjects, so the guidelines for reporting on such experiments do not apply.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 1<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 15: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: NA</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.</span><br><span style='color:#0000FF;'>Review: The answer provided by the authors is consistent with the paper content, and the justification correctly states that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Therefore, there's no requirement for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals or disclosures about potential risks to study participants. As this work focuses on the evaluation and propositions related to Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) for traffic prediction and architecture search, human subjects are not directly involved in the experiments or data collection. The research primarily deals with computational models, algorithm development, and analysis of traffic prediction performance, which do not entail ethical concerns related to human subjects.<br><br>Constructive and actionable suggestions are not applicable in this case since the question about IRB approvals or equivalent review processes does not pertain to the nature of the study conducted in the paper.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 1<br>--------------------------------------<br><h3> Post Submission Survey</h3><p><a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRIDkcXFbsOrR09j4qA1MlG4Rfir2lPD_u9YC4eqKBJ8tHkw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.463237339=VW5kZXJzdGFuZGluZyBhbmQgU2ltcGxpZnlpbmcgQXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlIFNlYXJjaGluIFNwYXRpby1UZW1wb3JhbCBHcmFwaCBOZXVyYWwgTmV0d29ya3M='>Click here to submit a post submission survey</a></p><br><br><br><br><br>
