Even though they mention not providing the information necessary for reproducing the experiments, the explanation suggests an oversight in addressing the guidelines' emphasis on reproducibility. The guidelines clearly state that if the paper includes experiments, ensuring reproducibility to some extent is crucial. The paper discusses the implementation of baseline submissions and evaluation methods, which directly relate to the main experimental results. Therefore, not providing sufficient information for reproducing these experiments undermines the paper's adherence to the guidelines. Furthermore, the statement "just the information for the challenge" does not align with the expectation of detailing either the steps to reproduce the results or providing necessary avenues for verification.<br><br>Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:<br><br>1. Detailed Description of Methods and Algorithms: Even if the code and specific datasets are not shared, the paper should include a comprehensive description of the methods, algorithms, and evaluation criteria used in the experiments. This description should be detailed enough to allow independent researchers to replicate the study with similar tools.<br><br>2. Baseline Information: Since the paper evaluates baseline submissions for AI-Author and AI-Reviewer tasks, it should clearly outline the parameters, architectures, and specific models used, including any modifications to existing models like ChatGPT.

Lack of Detailed Justification: The authors' justification is brief and lacks detail. They state that "The paper does not provide the link to open access to all relevant data and code" but fail to elaborate on why this is the case or if any alternative forms of access or information are provided in the paper or supplemental materials.<br><br>2. Missed Opportunities: The paper presents a novel platform and organizes a competition which involves generating and evaluating survey papers using AI. Given the nature of the competition and the involvement of AI models, sharing data, code, and instructions would be critical for reproducibility and further research. Not sharing these elements may affect the utility and impact of the paper.<br><br>3. Guidelines Alignment: According to the guidelines, while "No" is an acceptable answer, the authors are encouraged to provide as much detail and instruction as possible to allow for reproducibility, even if direct access to code and data cannot be provided. The justification does not mention any effort made in this direction, such as descriptions of methodologies or algorithms that could allow readers to approximate the experimental setup.<br><br>4. Supplemental Material: The guidelines also suggest providing detailed instructions and scripts in supplemental material to reproduce the experiments. The authors’ justification does not address whether any efforts were made to provide detailed methodologies, pseudocode, algorithmic descriptions, or any form of guidance in the paper or its supplemental materials to help with reproducibility.<br><br>Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:<br><br>a. Detailed Descriptions: If sharing code and data is not possible, the paper should include detailed descriptions of the methodologies, algorithms, and evaluation metrics used.

The paper does indeed include error bars in its experimental analysis, specifically in the sections discussing baseline results for both the AI-Author and AI-Reviewer tasks. The authors mention the use of standard error as a measure for the error bars, which corresponds to the variability in the experimental setup, and they explain how these error bars are calculated (across 15 subsets of good/bad papers, each containing 18 good/bad versions generated from identical prompts). This method of calculating error bars captures the variability in the experimental conditions and supports the main claims of the paper related to the performance and evaluation of AI models in the context of the Auto-survey Challenge. The guidelines for reporting statistical significance are thus appropriately adhered to in the paper.<br><br>Constructive Suggestions:<br>1. Clarify Assumptions: Although the paper explains the calculation of error bars, it could further clarify any statistical assumptions made, such as the normality of errors. This detail would enhance the reader's understanding of the statistical methods applied and ensure the appropriateness of error bar interpretation.<br><br>2. Discuss Statistical Significance Tests: While error bars are reported, the paper might benefit from explicitly discussing any statistical significance tests conducted to back the main experimental claims. Mentioning p-values or confidence intervals alongside error bars would provide a more comprehensive statistical analysis.<br><br>3. Reference Figures in Text: Ensure that each figure containing error bars is explicitly referenced and discussed within the text. This practice would help readers better understand how the error bars relate to the discussed results and conclusions.<br><br>4. Considerations for Asymmetric Distributions: In future work or revisions, if applicable, consider addressing the handling of asymmetric distributions. Advice on how to report error bars that accurately reflect the distribution of the data would be valuable, especially if symmetric error bars could mislead.<br><br>5. Reporting Confidence Levels: Explicitly state the confidence level of the error bars (e.g., 95% CI). Adding this information would standardize the interpretation and comparison of error margins across different studies.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 1<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 8: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: No</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: The paper does not provide any type of information regarding the computer resources</span><br><span style='color:#0000FF;'>Review: The authors answered "No" to the question regarding whether the paper provides sufficient information on the computer resources needed to reproduce the experiments, and justified this by stating that the paper does not provide any type of information regarding computer resources. This answer is consistent with the content of the paper provided for review, which focuses on the design of the competition, the implementation of baseline submissions, methods of evaluation, and the theory behind the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for creating and reviewing scientific papers, but does not delve into the specifics of the computational resources used.<br><br>Despite agreeing with the authors’ response, it is crucial to point out the importance of including details on computational resources for the benefit of reproducibility and transparency in academic research, particularly in fields involving complex computational models and AI systems.

The challenge involves AI systems as both authors and reviewers of survey papers, and human involvement is primarily in an editorial or organizational capacity, not as subjects of research.<br><br>However, to provide a complete review, it's important to assess the answer and justification against the paper content thoroughly:<br><br>1. The paper primarily introduces and discusses a competition designed to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating and reviewing academic survey papers. This involves AI-generated content and AI-based evaluation mechanisms.<br>2. Human involvement is mentioned in terms of participants creating AI models for the competition and organizers overseeing the challenge. There's no indication of human subjects' involvement in a manner that would require details about instructions, compensation, or ethical considerations typically associated with crowdsourcing or human subject research.<br>3. The methodological focus is on AI performance, evaluation metrics for AI-generated content, and comparisons between different AI models/baselines.<br><br>Based on this, the authors' answer appears to be aligned with the guidelines provided. Since the research does not involve human subjects in the traditional sense of participating in experiments where instructions, screenshots, or compensation details would be relevant, marking this question as NA with the given justification is appropriate and consistent with the paper content.<br><br>Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:<br>- Although not applicable in this context, it is good practice to explicitly mention the lack of human subject research early in the paper to clarify the ethical scope of the study for readers and reviewers.

Clarification on Human Oversight: While the paper mentions "human organizers serving in an editorial oversight capacity," it might benefit from a brief section discussing any ethical considerations or guidelines followed to ensure the fairness and integrity of the AI-generated content critique process.<br><br>2. Discussion on Human-AI Collaboration: Given the nature of the competition and its focus on autonomous literature review and critique by AI, a discussion on the potential implications for humans (researchers, students, etc.) involved in similar activities could enrich the manuscript. Specifically, exploring how this technology might impact the academic community and what safeguards are necessary to maintain the quality and ethics of scholarly work.<br><br>3. AI Ethics and Accountability: Although the paper touches upon “Responsibility” as one of the evaluation criteria, expanding on how AI-generated content adheres to ethical standards and the measures in place to prevent misuse (e.g., generating misleading or factually incorrect papers) would be valuable.<br><br>4. Future Human-AI Interaction Research: Encourage speculation or propose future work on how these automated systems might interact with human researchers or subjects.

The paper presents a competition for the development and evaluation of AI systems in autonomously composing and critiquing academic literature. The primary "subjects" of this research are AI systems, not humans. The competition involves AI-generated content and AI evaluations of this content, without direct human participation in the research process (apart from the human organizers in editorial oversight capacities and potential developers of AI models). Therefore, the concerns typically associated with human subjects research, such as potential risks to participants and the need for IRB approval, do not apply in the context described in the paper.<br><br>However, to offer constructive feedback and ensure thorough consideration of all ethical implications:<br>1. Clarify the Role of Humans: Even though the primary focus is on AI, ensure that any indirect involvement of humans (e.g., developers testing their systems, indirect effects on human subjects of study) is acknowledged and any associated risks are considered.<br>2. Assess Data Ethical Concerns: If any human-generated datasets were used to train or evaluate the AI systems, make sure that the ethical implications of using these datasets are discussed, including privacy concerns and consent for use.<br>3. Future Implications: Offer a discussion on the broader ethical implications of AI systems autonomously producing academic content, including the potential for misinformation, erosion of trust in scholarly communications, and impacts on academic integrity.<br>4. Maintain Transparency: If the competition or subsequent developments lead to any direct human research or user studies, ensure transparency regarding ethical considerations, potential risks, and IRB approval processes.<br><br>The answer NA remains valid based on the current description of the study.

The abstract introduces the novel platform for evaluating the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in autonomously composing and critiquing survey papers across a wide range of disciplines, and the introduction further expands on this by highlighting the motivation behind the challenge, its design, and the intended tasks (AI-Author and AI-Reviewer) along with the evaluation criteria. However, to improve clarity and provide a more robust justification aligned with the guidelines provided, a deeper analysis could strengthen the argument, especially regarding the reflection of claims on the contributions and scope.<br><br>Constructive Suggestions:<br>1. Explicit Contributions: To enhance clarity, explicitly list the paper's main contributions in bullet points either at the end of the introduction or in a separate designated section. This makes it easier for readers and reviewers to identify the novel aspects of your work.<br><br>2. Scope and Limitations: While the claims about the contributions and scope are clear, explicitly mentioning any limitations or assumptions in the introduction can provide a more balanced view. For instance, discussing the potential limitations of using LLMs in academic content generation and review, or any assumptions made during the challenge design, can offer a clearer picture of the paper's scope.<br><br>3. Theoretical vs. Experimental Match: While the abstract and introduction are comprehensive, ensure that the main claims are supported by both theoretical justifications and experimental results throughout the paper.

Given the nature of the work—advancing automated literature review functions—it's crucial to consider the broader implications, including negative societal impacts.<br><br>Justification for the score:<br><br>1. Lack of Discussion on Negative Societal Impacts: The paper's abstract and content suggest a significant move towards empowering AI with capabilities that have far-reaching consequences, including the potential for misuse in generating disinformative content or biased reviews. Such implications warrant a discussion which is missing.<br>2. Potential for Misuse: The ability of AI to autonomously compose and critique academic content can be misused for generating misleading surveys, perpetuating biases, or even fabricating research, none of which are addressed as per the justification given.<br>3. Fairness and Bias: The methodology involving Large Language Models (LLMs) might inherit or amplify existing biases in datasets, potentially leading to unfair outcomes in the automated review or generation of literature. This aspect is critically important to discuss under societal impacts.<br><br>Constructive Suggestions:<br><br>1. Explicit Section on Societal Impacts: Include a dedicated section discussing the potential positive and negative societal impacts, ensuring a holistic view of the technology's influence. This should entail an exploration of both direct and indirect impacts, encompassing misuse, data privacy, fairness, and bias considerations.<br>2.

While the paper presents an innovative competition framework for evaluating Large Language Models' (LLMs) capability to autonomously compose and critique academic literature, it overlooks the inherent risks associated with these technologies. LLMs, by their very nature, have the potential for misuse in generating disinformation, plagiarized content, or biased/false scientific knowledge, especially when the models are designed to autonomously generate survey papers and critiques. The authors' blanket dismissal does not account for these risks, nor does it consider the broader ethical implications of their deployment.<br><br>Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:<br>1. Risk Assessment: Authors should conduct a thorough risk assessment of the LLMs applied in their competition framework. This includes potential misuse for generating misleading or harmful content. A section discussing these risks and their implications should be added to the paper.<br>2. Safeguards Implementation: The paper should detail specific safeguards or mechanisms implemented to mitigate the identified risks. This may include content filters, measures to ensure citation accuracy and prevent the generation of false references, or mechanisms to detect and mitigate biases in generated content.<br>3. Ethical Considerations: A dedicated section on ethical considerations surrounding the use of LLMs in academic settings should be included. This section could elaborate on the potential for misuse and the broader implications of automating the literature review and critique process.<br>4. Model and Data Release Policies: Even if the authors believe their specific models do not pose a high risk, detailing their policy regarding the release of models and datasets would be beneficial. This could include usage guidelines, restrictions, and any safety filters or controls implemented.<br>5. Community Engagement: The authors are encouraged to engage with the broader AI ethics community to seek feedback and suggestions on responsibly deploying and sharing their LLMs. Documenting this engagement and the resultant actions taken could also add value to the paper.<br><br>By addressing these suggestions, the authors would not only strengthen their paper but also contribute positively to the ongoing discourse on the ethical use of AI in academia.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 12: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: No</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: The paper doesn't mention the name of the licence</span><br><span style='color:#0000FF;'>Review: Justification for Score:<br>The authors' answer, "No," acknowledging that the name of the license is not mentioned, suggests a recognition of incomplete compliance with the guidelines for properly crediting the creators or original owners of assets and explicitly mentioning license and terms of use. However, the paper acknowledges various sources (e.g., using ChatGPT, referencing scholarly articles, and mentioning support by INRIA, ANR, TAILOR EU Horizon 2020, and Google), but it lacks specific details about the licensing for the assets used, such as the versions of datasets, models (e.g., GPT-3.5), or software tools referenced. Although acknowledging this shortfall is a step in the right direction, it does not fully align with the guidelines provided, which emphasize the need for explicit citation, licensing details, and adherence to terms of use for all assets.<br><br>Constructive Suggestions:<br>1. Cite Original Creators: For each dataset, model, or code package used, the paper should explicitly cite the original publication or source where it was first introduced. This includes the use of models like GPT-3.5 and any software or datasets.<br><br>2. Specify Asset Versions and URLs: It will be beneficial to indicate the specific version of the assets utilized (e.g., version numbers of ChatGPT or other models) and, where possible, provide direct URLs to these assets. This will aid in reproducibility and validation of the used materials.<br><br>3. License Information: Directly state the license under which each asset is used, whether it is a dataset, model, or software tool. If the paper itself contributes any new datasets or models, the license under which these are released should also be clearly specified.<br><br>4. Compliance with Terms of Service: Ensure that the use of all assets, especially those obtained from web services or proprietary sources, complies with their terms of service or use. This might require a brief statement in the methodology or acknowledgments section about compliance.<br><br>5. Engagement with Asset Creators: If there is any uncertainty regarding the permissible use of an asset, or if the licensing information is not publicly available, the authors should reach out to the asset creators to clarify and document this communication.<br><br>By addressing these points, the paper will not only respect intellectual property rights more rigorously but also enhance its utility and reproducibility for future research efforts.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 13: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: NA</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: We don't introduce the new assents.</span><br><span style='color:#0000FF;'>Review: The justification provided by the authors claiming "We don't introduce new assets" seems incorrect based on the content of the paper. The paper does indeed introduce new methodologies and baseline implementations, such as the AI-Author based on ChatGPT, the AI-Referee-Reviewer, and a meta-review system for evaluating submissions. These are significant contributions in terms of software, methodology, and possibly datasets used for training or evaluation. Therefore, the claim that no new assets are introduced appears inconsistent with the contributions made in the paper.<br><br>Constructive and actionable suggestions:<br>1. Clarify the Definition of Assets: The authors should clearly define what they consider as "assets" in the context of their paper. If they consider assets to simply be data or code, they should specify this. However, given the new implementations and methodologies introduced, these should also be considered as assets.<br><br>2. Documentation of Assets: For each asset introduced, including software implementations and methods, provide detailed documentation. This should encompass information about the design, implementation, intended use, limitations, and any dependencies or prerequisites required for operation.<br><br>3. Anonymize and Share Assets for Review: If possible, share anonymized versions of the assets (e.g., software code, evaluation frameworks) as supplementary material for the review process. This enables reviewers and readers to better understand the contributions and assess the reproducibility of the results.<br><br>4. Licensing and Accessibility Information: Include information about the licensing of the assets. If the assets are open source, specify the license under which they are released. This clarifies the legal permissions granted for use, modification, and distribution.<br><br>5. Limitations and Reproducibility: Discuss the limitations of the introduced assets and their expected performance in various contexts. Additionally, provide guidelines or instructions to ensure the reproducibility of the results presented in the paper, including any specific hardware or software requirements.<br><br>6. Consent and Ethical Considerations: If any human-generated content or data is used within the introduced assets, clarify how consent was obtained and address any ethical considerations related to privacy, bias, and usage rights.<br><br>These suggestions aim to enhance the transparency, reproducibility, and ethical considerations associated with the assets introduced in the paper.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 14: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: NA</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: This does not apply on our research as we are not doing any crowdsourcing experiments</span><br><span style='color:#0000FF;'>Review: While the answer provided by the authors is marked as "NA" with the justification noting the absence of crowdsourcing experiments or research involving human subjects, this stands as consistent with the content and scope described in the given paper excerpts. The paper primarily focuses on a novel platform for evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to autonomously compose and critique survey papers across various disciplines, organized around a competition format. The challenge itself involves simulations of peer review mechanisms for submissions created by AI systems, under human editorial supervision rather than through interactions involving crowdsourcing or direct research with human subjects in a traditional sense.<br><br>Given this context, the requirements for including detailed instructions given to human participants, screenshots, or specifics concerning compensation do not directly apply to the nature of this study. The core of the paper is centered on the automated generation and evaluation of academic content by AI, without an apparent involvement of crowdsourcing or external human subjects in experimental procedures that would necessitate the detailed disclosures outlined in the NeurIPS guidelines for such contexts.<br><br>Constructive and Actionable Suggestions:<br><br>1. Clarify the Role of Humans: Although the paper correctly marks the question as not applicable, it would enhance clarity to briefly outline the role of any human participants within the competition setup. Specifically, mentioning the editorial oversight and how participants interact with the platform could preempt any ambiguity regarding human involvement, ensuring a clear understanding that it does not constitute "research with human subjects" in the conventional sense.<br><br>2. Broader Ethical Considerations: Even if direct compensation to human subjects or crowdsourcing protocols do not apply, articulating any ethical considerations taken into account during the design and execution of the competition, especially in terms of fairness, privacy, and the potential impact of AI-generated content, would strengthen the paper's alignment with broader ethical guidelines.<br><br>3. Explain Exemption Criteria: For completeness and to aid in the transparency of the methodology, a brief section commenting on the absence of traditional human subject involvement and justifying why detailed instructions or compensation details are not provided could be informative for readers. This would explicitly address the exemption from certain NeurIPS guidelines and reinforce the paper's compliance with ethical standards.<br><br>These suggestions aim to bolster the paper’s adherence to ethical considerations and reporting standards without detracting from its primary focus on advancing AI capabilities in academic content generation and evaluation.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 1<br>--------------------------------------<br>--------------------------------------<br>Question # 15: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?<br><span style='color:#008000;'>Answer: NA</span><br><span style='color:#008000;'>Justification: This does not concerns us as we are not dealing with human subjects in our research.</span><br><span style='color:#0000FF;'>Review: Justification for Score:<br>The authors' response that the section on potential risks and IRB approvals is not applicable (NA) because "we are not dealing with human subjects in our research" overlooks a crucial aspect of their study. Although the research primarily involves the use of AI systems (Large Language Models and AI-Referee-Reviewer), there is an indirect involvement of human subjects in several capacities: as participants in the competition, as creators of the "good" and "bad" versions of papers used for evaluations, and potentially within the final phase of the competition where a "human jury" evaluates the final code submission. The involvement of humans in these processes, especially in evaluative or judgmental capacities, introduces ethical considerations that merit acknowledgment and assessment for potential risks.<br><br>Constructive Suggestions:<br>1. Risk Assessment for Participants: The authors should undertake a risk assessment for all human participants involved in the study, including competitors in the Auto-survey Challenge and members of the human jury. This should include any potential risks related to data privacy, psychological stress, or intellectual property disputes.<br><br>2. Ethical Oversight: While it might not fall strictly under the purview of traditional IRB review due to the nature of the study primarily focusing on AI, the study design implicates ethical considerations that justify some form of ethical oversight. The authors could consult their institution's ethics committee for guidance or at least establish an ethical framework for conducting the competition, particularly addressing the confidentiality and fair use of participants' submissions.<br><br>3. Disclosure of Risks to Participants: If any risks are identified, the authors should ensure that all participants are fully informed about these risks before participating in the challenge. This could be done through detailed informed consent forms or terms of participation that clearly outline what involvement entails.<br><br>4. Revision of IRB Statement: Amend the paper to include a statement reflecting the consideration of these ethical aspects. Even if formal IRB approval is not necessary, a statement that acknowledges the ethical considerations and measures taken to mitigate potential risks to humans indirectly involved in the research will strengthen the paper.<br><br>5. Transparency and Anonymity Assurance: Given the competition and peer-review mechanism involves human judgment, ensure that measures are in place to maintain the anonymity of submissions where required and to protect the integrity of the evaluation process. This should also be articulated in the ethical considerations section of the paper.<br><br>By addressing these points, the authors can enhance the ethical rigor of their study while adequately complying with the guidelines provided for addressing potential risks and ethical considerations in research involving human participants, even if indirectly.<br></span><br>Correctness Score: 0<br>--------------------------------------<br><h3> Post Submission Survey</h3><p><a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfRIDkcXFbsOrR09j4qA1MlG4Rfir2lPD_u9YC4eqKBJ8tHkw/viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.463237339=QXV0by1zdXJ2ZXkgQ2hhbGxlbmdlOkFkdmFuY2luZyB0aGUgRnJvbnRpZXJzIG9mIEF1dG9tYXRlZCBMaXRlcmF0dXJlUmV2aWV34oiX'>Click here to submit a post submission survey</a></p><br><br><br><br><br>
