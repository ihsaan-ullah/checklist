","## Feedback on NeurIPS Paper Checklist Answer

The proposed answer and justification seem accurate at a high level. However, there are areas where the justification could be strengthened by providing more specific references to the paper's content:

* **Specificity:** While the justification mentions that the claims align with the paper's content, it would be beneficial to explicitly point to specific sections (e.g., Section 4.1, Figure 2) that directly support the claims made in the abstract and introduction. This adds clarity and allows reviewers to quickly verify the alignment.
* **Assumptions and Limitations:** The guidelines emphasize the importance of stating any assumptions and limitations.  The justification could be improved by mentioning where in the paper these are discussed (e.g., Section 7.1).
* **Generalizability:** The claims should reflect the extent to which the results can be generalized. Pointing to evidence or discussion of generalizability (e.g., Section 6.6) would strengthen the justification.

**Actionable Improvements:**

1. **Revise the justification to include specific section references for key claims (e.g., DPO's performance, efficiency, and comparison to RLHF).** 
2. **Indicate where the paper discusses assumptions and limitations of the approach.**
3. **Mention any sections that address the generalizability of the results.**

Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?,Limitations,Yes,"Limitations are discussed in “Limitations & Future Work"" section.","If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
","## Feedback on Limitations Section

The ""Limitations & Future Work"" section in the provided paper does discuss limitations but could be improved by addressing the guidelines more comprehensively. 

Here are some key areas for improvement:

* **Strong Assumptions and Robustness:**  The paper should explicitly identify the assumptions made by DPO, such as the validity of the Bradley-Terry model for capturing human preferences or the dependence on the reference model. Discuss how violations of these assumptions (e.g., more complex preference structures, suboptimal reference models) would impact the results and the potential implications for real-world applications.
* **Scope of Claims:**  While the paper mentions testing on different tasks and model sizes, it should further reflect on the limitations of the datasets used. Are they representative of real-world scenarios? Are there biases present in the data?  Additionally, consider discussing the limitations of using GPT-4 as a proxy for human evaluation and potential biases it might introduce. 
* **Performance Factors:**  Analyze how different factors, such as the quality of the preference data, the choice of the reference model, or the temperature parameter, influence the performance of DPO.  This provides a more nuanced understanding of the method's strengths and weaknesses under various conditions.
* **Computational Efficiency:** While DPO eliminates the need for RL, a discussion comparing the computational costs of DPO with existing RLHF methods (training and inference) would be beneficial.  This would highlight the practical advantages of DPO, especially for training large models.
* **Privacy and Fairness:**   The paper briefly mentions the importance of safety and controllability in the introduction. However, due to the nature of preference learning, potential issues related to bias amplification and fairness should be explicitly discussed in the limitations section. 

Addressing these points will strengthen the paper by providing a more thorough and transparent analysis of DPO's limitations.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Paper Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer and justification seem partially inaccurate based on the provided paper excerpt and guidelines. Here's a breakdown:

**Discrepancies/Issues:**

* **Missing Proof Sketches:** While the justification mentions proofs in the appendix, the guidelines encourage providing brief proof sketches in the main paper for intuition, which seem to be missing. 
* **Unclear Assumption Presentation:**  The guidelines emphasize clearly stating or referencing assumptions within theorem statements. The paper excerpt doesn't offer enough information to ascertain if this is properly done.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1. **Include Proof Sketches:** For each theorem presented in sections 4, 5, and Appendix A, add short proof sketches in the main paper to enhance reader understanding and provide intuition behind the formal proofs.
2. **Clarify Assumption Presentation:**  Review the theorems in sections 4, 5, and Appendix A. Ensure all assumptions are either explicitly stated within the theorem or have clear references to where they are defined in the paper.

While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
    - If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
    - If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
    - If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
    - We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

","## Feedback on Reproducibility Disclosure

While the ""Paper"" mentions key details about the DPO method, including the loss function and its derivation, several aspects relevant to reproducibility require clarification:

* **Hyperparameters:** While Appendix B mentions some defaults, the specific hyperparameters used for each experiment (sentiment, summarization, dialogue) are not explicitly stated in Section 6 or the related Appendices. This information is crucial for reproducing the exact results.
* **Model Architectures:** The paper mentions using GPT-2-large and Pythia-2.8B as base models but doesn't fully describe the architectures or modifications made during SFT or DPO training. Clearer descriptions or references to the specific model versions and configurations would enhance reproducibility.
* **Data Preprocessing:**  The paper mentions using pre-trained reward models and datasets like IMDB and TL;DR but lacks details on specific pre-processing steps, data splits, or versions used. More information about this aspect is necessary for researchers to accurately replicate the experiments.
* **Training Details:** The paper mentions the number of training epochs for reward modeling in the sentiment experiment but lacks similar details for other experiments. Information about training duration, stopping criteria, and hardware used would be beneficial for reproducibility.

## Actionable Improvements:

1. **Expand Section 6 and Appendices:** Include tables summarizing the hyperparameters, model architectures, datasets, pre-processing steps, and training details for each experiment.
2. **Clarify Model Modifications:**  Describe any modifications made to base models during SFT or DPO training, such as the addition of specific layers or changes to the training objectives. 
3. **Data and Code Availability:**  While not mandatory for NeurIPS, consider providing access to code and data or outlining a clear process for obtaining them, to further enhance reproducibility and facilitate future research.

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
","## Feedback on Error Bar Reporting in NeurIPS Paper

The paper mentions the importance of controlling LM behavior and aligning it with human preferences, but it primarily focuses on the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm and its comparison to RLHF methods.

* **Types of Error Bars:**  The paper does not specify the type of error bars used in the experiments (e.g., standard deviation, standard error, confidence intervals). 
* **Variability Factors:**  There is no clear explanation of the factors contributing to variability in the results. While the paper mentions controlling for KL divergence during training, it does not clarify the role of other potential sources of variability, such as random seeds or data splits.
* **Calculation Methods:**  The paper does not describe the specific methods used to calculate the error bars. 
* **Assumptions:**  There is no mention of any underlying assumptions regarding error distributions (e.g., normality).
* **Error Bar Visualization:**  The paper refers to Appendix B and C for details, but it's unclear if the error bars are visually represented in figures or tables.

The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?,Documentation,Yes,Yes. See Appendix B.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. 
The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
","## Discrepancies and Improvement Opportunities

The ""Paper"" focuses on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for language models and doesn't explicitly introduce new assets like datasets, models, or code. However, it utilizes several existing resources:

* **Datasets:** IMDb, Reddit TL;DR, Anthropic HH, CNN/DailyMail
* **Models:** GPT-2-large, GPT-J, Pythia-2.8B
* **Tools:** TRLX, siebert/sentiment-roberta-large-english, GPT-4

While Appendix B provides implementation details for DPO, it lacks documentation for the above-mentioned assets. 

Here's how the authors can improve the paper:

1. **Clarify Asset Usage:** In the main paper, explicitly state that the research relies on existing datasets/models/tools and mention them briefly. 
2. **Dedicated Asset Documentation:** Create a separate section (e.g., ""Data and Resources"") to comprehensively detail each asset:
    * **Source and Version:** Provide clear references including URLs and version numbers. 
    * **Description:** Explain the asset's purpose and content.
    * **License:** Specify the license under which the asset is available. 
    * **Limitations:** Discuss potential biases or limitations of the asset.
3. **Ethical Considerations (if applicable):**  Explain how consent was obtained for any data involving human subjects. If using datasets with potential ethical concerns, discuss steps taken to mitigate risks.

"For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?",Human subjects,Yes,See Appendix D.3.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. 
According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Paper Checklist Answer

**Discrepancies:**

* While Appendix D.3 is mentioned as the justification for including participant instructions and compensation details, the provided paper excerpt does not contain an Appendix D.3. 
*  The paper focuses on training language models with preference comparisons, not directly on crowdsourcing or human subject research. 

**Actionable Feedback:**

1. **Clarify Justification or Revise Answer:**
    * If Appendix D.3 exists in the full paper and contains the required information, ensure the appendix label is correct and consider mentioning the specific type of information included (e.g., ""See Appendix D.3 for participant instructions and compensation details"").
    * If the information is not present, revise the answer to ""NA"" and provide a brief justification stating that the paper's focus is on preference-based language model training, not direct human subject research.

2. **(Optional) Enhance Transparency:**
    *  Even though the main contribution isn't focused on human subjects, consider briefly mentioning in the main paper how preference data was collected (e.g., ""We collected preference data using pairwise comparisons from human annotators""). This enhances transparency and allows readers to understand the context of the research.

The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. 
We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. 
For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
","## Analysis of Authors' Proposed Answer and Justification

The authors have correctly identified that the paper involves human subjects research (human labelers expressing preferences). However, the paper does not mention any ethical considerations, such as IRB approval or potential risks to participants. Therefore, the proposed answer ""No"" with the provided justification is accurate.

## Actionable Feedback

*   **Clearly state the absence of IRB approval (or equivalent):** While the justification mentions the lack of IRB approval, it's crucial to explicitly state this in the paper itself. This should be done in a dedicated section discussing ethical considerations or limitations.
*   **Address potential risks to participants:**  Even if IRB approval wasn't required, the authors should discuss potential risks faced by participants (e.g., exposure to potentially offensive content) and explain how these risks were mitigated (e.g., allowing participants to opt-out of specific tasks).
*   **Demonstrate adherence to ethical guidelines:** Include a statement expressing adherence to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and relevant institutional guidelines. This shows commitment to responsible research practices.
