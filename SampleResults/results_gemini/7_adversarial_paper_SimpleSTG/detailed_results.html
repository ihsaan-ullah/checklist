Here are some key areas for improvement, based on the NeurIPS guidelines:<ul><li><b>Assumptions:</b> The paper lacks a clear discussion of the underlying assumptions made in the proposed framework and the potential consequences of violating them. For example, are there implicit assumptions about the data distribution, graph structure, or model complexity? How would the results change if these assumptions don't hold?</li><li><b>Scope of Claims:</b> The paper primarily focuses on traffic prediction and uses datasets from California. The authors should address the generalizability of their findings to other domains and diverse datasets. How might factors like different traffic patterns or graph structures affect the results?</li><li><b>Factors Influencing Performance:</b> While the paper analyzes the impact of architectural choices, it doesn't delve into other factors that could affect performance.

Consider areas like urban planning, climate modeling, or disease spread prediction, depending on the model's capabilities.</li><li><b>Address potential misuses:</b>  The paper should consider potential negative consequences of STGNNs, such as privacy violations if used with sensitive location data,  potential biases within the model leading to unfair outcomes for certain groups, or the possibility of misuse for surveillance purposes.</li><li><b>Discuss mitigation strategies:</b> For each identified potential negative impact, propose strategies to mitigate them. This could include data anonymization techniques, bias detection and correction methods, or implementing ethical guidelines for STGNN development and deployment.</li><li><b>Balance positive and negative aspects:</b>  While discussing potential risks, don't forget to highlight the potential positive impacts of STGNNs, such as improved efficiency in resource allocation, better disaster preparedness, or advancements in scientific research.</li></ul>By addressing these points in the "Broader Impact Statement" section, the paper will demonstrate a more comprehensive understanding of the societal implications of the research and provide valuable insights for responsible development and deployment of STGNN technology.</div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> <h3>Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer</h3>The authors' proposed answer of "NA" with the justification "This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects" is <b>correct and aligns with the paper's content and the guidelines</b>.However, there are a few minor points that could improve clarity and adherence to the guidelines:<ul><li><b>Explicit IRB statement</b>: While the justification clarifies the absence of human subject research, explicitly stating that IRB approval is not applicable due to the nature of the work would enhance clarity and directly address the guideline's recommendation. This could be a simple sentence added to the justification, such as: "Therefore, Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval is not applicable to this work."</li><li><b>Ethical considerations</b>: Although IRB approval is not needed, briefly mentioning adherence to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics could demonstrate the authors' commitment to responsible research conduct.</li></ul></div>
