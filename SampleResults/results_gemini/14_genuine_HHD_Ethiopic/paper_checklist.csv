","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer and justification seem partially correct. While the introduction does list the contributions, the abstract could be further improved to more accurately reflect the paper's scope and contributions.

**Here are some actionable improvements:**

* **Quantify the dataset size in the abstract:** Instead of stating ""roughly 80,000,"" specify the exact number of annotated text-line images.
* **Highlight the novelty of the OOD test set in the abstract:**  Emphasize the significance of the 18th-century test set for evaluating model performance in a more realistic OOD scenario.
* **Mention the specific SOTA models used and their types in the abstract:** Instead of just stating ""SOTA OCR models,"" list the specific models (e.g., Transformer, attention, CTC-based) used for evaluation.
* **Outline the main findings regarding model performance in the abstract:** Briefly mention how the models performed on both the IID and OOD test sets, including the achievement of human-level performance on the 18th-century set and surpassing human performance on the IID set.

The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
","## Feedback on Limitations Discussion

The provided ""Justification"" mentions three aspects: annotator information sharing, limited computational resources, and future work. However, it does not comprehensively address the guidelines for discussing limitations.

Here's how to improve the paper's discussion of limitations:

* **Create a dedicated “Limitations” section:** This will provide a clear space to elaborate on the limitations without disrupting the flow of other sections. 
* **Expand on computational limitations:** Discuss the training time, inference speed, and scalability of the models, especially in relation to dataset size. Compare the computational efficiency of different models.
* **Analyze error patterns:** Discuss the types of errors the models make (insertions, deletions, substitutions) and in what context they occur. Relate this to specific challenges of the Ethiopic script (diacritics, similar characters).
* **Address data limitations:** Discuss the potential bias introduced by the data collection process and the limitations of using synthetic data for underrepresented characters. 
* **Generalizability:** Reflect on the scope of the claims and the applicability of the results to different types of manuscripts or writing styles. Discuss potential performance variations due to factors like image quality, script variations, or document layout.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The author's proposed answer of ""NA"" with the justification ""Our paper does not include any theory"" is **correct and aligns with the paper's content and the guidelines**. The paper focuses on introducing a new dataset for Ethiopic OCR and evaluating baseline models, with no theoretical results presented.

However, there are opportunities to improve the paper's clarity and completeness regarding related aspects:

*   **Mention the Absence of Theoretical Results:** While the ""Answer"" is correct, consider briefly mentioning in the ""Related Work"" or ""Conclusion"" sections that the paper focuses on empirical evaluation and dataset creation without delving into theoretical contributions. This would provide context for readers specifically interested in theoretical advancements in Ethiopic OCR.
*   **Dataset Creation Details:** Elaborate on the selection process for the manuscripts used in the dataset. Explain how the documents were chosen and what criteria were considered (e.g., representativeness, diversity of writing styles, historical periods).

While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
    - If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
    - If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
    - If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
    - We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

","## Feedback on Reproducibility Disclosure:

* **Missing Model Details:**  While Section 3.2 mentions using ""state-of-the-art Transformer, attention, and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based methods,"" it lacks specifics about the architecture and hyperparameters of these models.  This information is crucial for researchers attempting to replicate the results.

* **Missing Training Details:** The paper mentions using Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning but doesn't specify the search space or final hyperparameter values. Additionally, details like optimizer, learning rate scheduler, and data augmentation techniques are missing.

* **Code Availability:** Although the paper claims code is available at a GitHub repository, it would be beneficial to explicitly mention the specific files containing the training and evaluation scripts within that repository.

## Recommendations for Improvement:

While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

*   **Clarify the meaning of the box plots:** Explain what the boxes and whiskers represent (e.g., interquartile range, range, median). If they are intended as error bars, explicitly state this and define the specific type of error bar (e.g., standard deviation, standard error). 
*   **Explain the method for calculating the error bars:** If applicable, describe the formula or library function used. If bootstrapping was employed, explain the procedure.
*   **State the assumptions made:** For example, mention if the analysis assumes normally distributed errors. 
*   **Report confidence intervals or p-values:** If appropriate, provide confidence intervals for the reported metrics or p-values from statistical tests to demonstrate the significance of the results.
*   **Address the variability factors:** Describe the sources of variability captured by the error bars, such as train/test splits, initialization, or random parameter draws.
*   **Discuss the limitations of the analysis:**  Acknowledge any limitations due to the lack of extensive statistical analysis.

The author's proposed answer (""Yes"") and justification (""All details are provided in the experimental section"") are **inconsistent** with the actual paper content. The paper lacks specific details about the computer resources used for experiments, such as:

* **Type of compute workers:** The paper doesn't mention whether CPUs, GPUs, or both were used for training and evaluation.
* **Memory and storage:**  No information is provided on the memory capacity of the machines or the storage space required for the dataset and models. 
* **Execution time:** The paper doesn't quantify the time needed to run each experiment or the total compute time for the entire project.
* **Compute disclosure:**  It's unclear whether the reported experiments represent the full computational cost or if additional experiments were conducted but not included in the paper.

### Actionable improvements:

1. **Specify compute worker type:** Clearly state whether CPUs, GPUs, or a combination were used, including the specific models (e.g., NVIDIA RTX A6000).
2. **Quantify resources:**  Report the memory capacity and storage requirements for the dataset and trained models.
3. **Report execution time:** Provide the execution time for individual experiment runs and estimate the total compute time for the project.

While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
","## Feedback on Societal Impact Discussion

The author's proposed answer (""Yes"") and justification (""All potential impact is positive"") are misaligned with the guidelines and the paper's content. 

Here's why:

* **Missing discussion**: The paper does not discuss potential societal impacts, neither positive nor negative. 
* **Unrealistic assumption**: Claiming ""all potential impact is positive"" is unrealistic and contradicts the guideline's expectation for a balanced discussion. 

Here's how to improve:

1. **Dedicate a section**: Add a section titled ""Societal Impact"" or similar, explicitly discussing potential implications of the work.
2. **Explore positive impacts**: Elaborate on how the HHD-Ethiopic dataset and improved Ethiopic OCR can benefit research areas like history, linguistics, and cultural heritage preservation.  
3. **Acknowledge potential risks**:  Discuss possible negative impacts, even if deemed unlikely. Consider areas like:
    * **Misuse**: Could the technology be used to create fake historical documents or manipulate information? 
    * **Bias**:  Does the dataset or model training process introduce any biases that could unfairly impact specific groups?
    * **Access and Equity**:  Are there any barriers to access or potential inequalities arising from the technology's implementation?

2. **Address Consent:** Discuss whether consent was obtained for using the historical manuscripts. If consent wasn't applicable (e.g., due to the age of the manuscripts and lack of identifiable individuals), clearly explain the rationale.
3. **Clarify Anonymization:**  Explicitly explain the anonymization process employed for the dataset, including details about any anonymized URLs or procedures used to protect sensitive information.

"For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?",Human subjects,Not Applicable,There were no crowdsourcing experiments conducted.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. 
According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer of ""NA"" with the justification ""There were no crowdsourcing experiments conducted"" is **consistent with the paper's content**.  The paper focuses on developing a new dataset for historical handwritten Ethiopic script recognition and evaluating baseline OCR models. There is no mention of any experiments involving human subjects or crowdsourcing.

However, I suggest the following improvements to enhance the paper's clarity and completeness:

* **Explicitly state the absence of human subject research:** While the ""NA"" answer implies it, explicitly stating that the research did not involve human subjects in the main paper or the appendix would remove any ambiguity. This can be a brief sentence in the introduction or the dataset description section. 
* **Mention data collection procedures:** Briefly describing how the historical documents were obtained and digitized  would provide valuable context about the dataset creation process. This could be included in the dataset description section.

"Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?",Risks,Not Applicable,This is not needed for this work.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. 
We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. 
For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

**Discrepancies:**

* The justification provided (""This is not needed for this work"") is insufficient. While the paper may not involve direct interaction or data collection from living individuals, it utilizes historical manuscripts which could raise ethical considerations, especially concerning data provenance and potential cultural sensitivities. 

**Actionable Feedback:**

1. **Address Ethical Considerations:**  
   * **Data Provenance:**  Clearly describe the origin and acquisition process of the historical manuscripts. Specify whether permissions were obtained from relevant institutions or communities for their use in the research.
   * **Cultural Sensitivity:**  Acknowledge the potential cultural significance of the manuscripts and outline any measures taken to ensure respectful handling and representation of the content. 
2. **Consider Broader Impacts:**  
    * Elaborate on the potential societal implications of the research, both positive and negative. Discuss how the developed OCR technology could affect the access to and interpretation of historical knowledge. 
3. **Improve Justification:**  
    * Instead of stating ""This is not needed for this work"", explain why IRB approval or equivalent ethical review was not sought. This could involve demonstrating that the data used does not contain any personally identifiable information or sensitive cultural content.
