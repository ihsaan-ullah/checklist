Compare the computational efficiency of different models.</li><li><b>Analyze error patterns:</b> Discuss the types of errors the models make (insertions, deletions, substitutions) and in what context they occur. Relate this to specific challenges of the Ethiopic script (diacritics, similar characters).</li><li><b>Address data limitations:</b> Discuss the potential bias introduced by the data collection process and the limitations of using synthetic data for underrepresented characters.</li><li><b>Generalizability:</b> Reflect on the scope of the claims and the applicability of the results to different types of manuscripts or writing styles. Discuss potential performance variations due to factors like image quality, script variations, or document layout.</li></ul></div>
