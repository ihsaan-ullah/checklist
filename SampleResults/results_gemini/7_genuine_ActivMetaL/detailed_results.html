This makes it difficult for reviewers to quickly verify the claim.</li><li><b>Overly Broad Claims:</b> The abstract mentions the paper proposes and studies an active learning version of the CofiRank algorithm and compares it with baseline methods. However, the paper also discusses the problem setting, related work, benchmark data, and experimental results, which are not explicitly mentioned as contributions in the abstract.</li><li><b>Limited Scope Mention:</b>  While the abstract mentions active meta-learning and algorithm recommendation, it doesn't explicitly state the specific type of algorithms or tasks considered (e.g., classification, regression).  The introduction clarifies this to some extent, but the abstract could be more specific about the scope.</li></ul><h3>Actionable Improvements:</h3><ol><li> <b>Refine Justification:</b>  Modify the justification to explicitly point to the sections in the paper where the main claims, contributions, and scope are discussed. For example, "The abstract (lines X-Y) and introduction (lines Z-W) clearly state the paper's main contributions, which include ... The paper focuses on ...  as described in section ...".</li><li> <b>Expand Abstract:</b> Briefly mention the key aspects of the paper in the abstract, including the problem setting, methodology, and main findings. For example, "... We present the problem setting of active meta-learning for algorithm recommendation and introduce ACTIVMETAL, an active learning approach based on the CofiRank algorithm. ...  We benchmark ACTIVMETAL on various datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to baseline methods ...".</li><li> <b>Clarify Scope:</b>  Explicitly state the type of algorithms and tasks considered in the abstract. For example, "... We focus on the task of recommending machine learning algorithms for classification and regression problems ...".</li></ol></div>

Here are some key suggestions for improvement:<b>1. Create a Dedicated "Limitations" Section:</b>This would provide a clear and organized space to discuss the limitations in detail, improving the paper's structure and clarity.<b>2. Analyze Robustness to Violated Assumptions:</b>The paper assumes algorithms have comparable computational time and neglects the cost of meta-learning compared to training and testing. Discuss how these assumptions might be violated in practice and the potential consequences. For example, explain how the approach might perform when dealing with algorithms with vastly different runtimes or when the meta-learning dataset becomes significantly large.<b>3. Reflect on the Scope of the Claims:</b>The paper primarily focuses on full matrices and doesn't discuss performance with sparse matrices, despite mentioning its potential. Also, acknowledge the limited number of benchmark datasets used and how this might affect the generalizability of the results.<b>4. Discuss Factors Influencing Performance:</b>The paper briefly mentions the exploration/exploitation trade-off but doesn't delve into other factors that might influence the approach's performance. Consider discussing the impact of different dataset characteristics (e.g., size, feature types, class imbalance) or the choice of performance metrics on the effectiveness of the proposed method.<b>5. Computational Efficiency and Scalability:</b>While the paper briefly mentions the computational cost of running algorithms, it doesn't discuss the scalability of the approach with increasing dataset size. Consider analyzing the computational complexity of the algorithms involved and how they would scale with larger meta-learning datasets.<b>6. Address Privacy and Fairness Concerns (if applicable):</b>While not immediately apparent from the provided information, consider if the proposed approach raises any potential privacy or fairness concerns in certain applications. Discuss any potential biases or discriminatory outcomes that might arise from the approach and suggest potential mitigation strategies.</div>

The paper focuses on empirical evaluation of an active meta-learning approach for algorithm recommendation and doesn't seem to involve theoretical proofs or derivations.However, despite the absence of theoretical results, the paper could benefit from improved structuring and presentation of its methodology and algorithms. Here are a few actionable suggestions:<ul><li><b>Formalization of Algorithm 1 (ACTIVMETAL):</b> While the overall goal and iterative nature are clear, a more formal description of the algorithm would enhance clarity. This could involve specifying the data structures used (e.g., types of S and t), termination conditions, and the exact output format.</li><li><b>Clarity on Initialization Schemes (Algorithms 2-5):</b> The paper mentions "randperm" and "median" as initialization schemes, but lacks details on their implementation and rationale. Explain the specific criteria used for selecting the initial algorithm and justify the choices. Additionally, clarify whether the "r" vectors in these algorithms represent ranks or scores.</li><li><b>Explain CofiRank Integration (Algorithms 4-5):</b> The paper mentions using CofiRank for active meta-learning but provides minimal information on how it's integrated with the ACTIVMETAL framework. Explain how CofiRank is utilized to prioritize the selection of the next algorithm, including details on the input and output of the CofiRank function.</li></ul></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> <h3>Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer</h3>The authors' proposed answer of "NA" with the justification "This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects" seems appropriate for the question regarding potential risks to study participants and IRB approval.However, there are a few potential areas where the paper could be improved for clarity and completeness:<ul><li><b>Explicitly state the absence of human subjects research</b>: While the justification mentions it, adding a clear statement in the main paper body (e.g., in the Introduction or a dedicated Ethics section) that the research does not involve human subjects would remove any ambiguity for reviewers and readers.</li><li><b>Consider potential ethical implications</b>: Even without human subjects, it's worth reflecting on potential ethical implications of the research, especially regarding bias in the datasets used or the potential impact of algorithm recommendations on real-world applications. This could be briefly mentioned in the Discussion or Conclusion section.</li></ul></div>
