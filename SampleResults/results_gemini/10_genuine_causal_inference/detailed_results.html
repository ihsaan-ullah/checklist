This should be elaborated on, discussing potential batch effects and the impact on estimated review quality. Additionally, the paper relies on monotonicity and Lipschitz smoothness assumptions for partial identification. While the suitability of these assumptions is discussed, the potential consequences of their violation should be explicitly addressed.</li><li>  <b>Review Quality Measures:</b>  The paper acknowledges the potential limitations of self-reported expertise and confidence as measures of review quality. Expanding on this, the paper could discuss alternative measures like meta-reviews or consider exploring potential biases inherent in self-reported data.</li><li>  <b>Generalizability:</b> The authors recognize the limitations of drawing conclusions based on data from only two venues. Suggestions for future work to examine the generalizability of the findings would strengthen the discussion.</li></ul><h3>Recommendations</h3><ul><li>  <b>Expand discussion on "no interference" assumption</b>, including potential batch effects and limitations of the current analysis.</li><li>  <b>Further explore limitations of self-reported review quality measures</b>, consider alternative measures or potential bias mitigation strategies.</li><li>  <b>Discuss generalizability concerns in more detail</b>, propose specific avenues for future work to address them.</li></ul><h3>Score</h3></div>

The paper focuses on empirical evaluation of peer-review assignment policies using off-policy evaluation methods, and does not involve proving theoretical results.However, there are potential areas for improvement related to the clarity and scope of the paper:<ul><li>  <b>Terminology:</b> While the paper doesn't present theoretical results, it introduces and relies on concepts like "positivity," "Manski bounds," "monotonicity," and "Lipschitz smoothness," which could be perceived as theoretical foundations for the empirical analysis. Consider adding a section clarifying the paper's scope and explaining these concepts for a broader audience. This would improve the understanding and accessibility of the paper for readers unfamiliar with these terms.</li><li>  <b>Assumptions:</b> The paper introduces assumptions like monotonicity and Lipschitz smoothness to perform partial identification and tighten the bounds on the estimated review quality. While these assumptions are intuitively explained, it would be beneficial to provide a more formal definition and discuss their implications in the context of peer review. Additionally, consider including a sensitivity analysis to explore how the results change under different assumptions or violations of these assumptions. This would strengthen the robustness of the findings and demonstrate the limitations of the analysis.</li></ul></div>
