This creates a disconnect as the dataset is a significant contribution of the paper but receives minimal attention in the abstract.</li><li><b>Introduction Focus:</b> Similar to the abstract, the introduction heavily focuses on MOHPO, dedicating only a small portion to the HHD-Ethiopic dataset and its significance.</li></ul><b>Actionable Feedback:</b><ul><li><b>Improve Abstract Balance:</b> Revise the abstract to give more prominence to the HHD-Ethiopic dataset.  Clearly state its purpose, size, and key characteristics. Ensure the abstract accurately reflects the balance between MOHPO and the dataset as presented in the paper.</li><li><b>Enhance Introduction Structure:</b> Restructure the introduction to provide a more balanced overview. Begin by introducing the importance of Ethiopic OCR and the challenges of limited datasets. Then, transition smoothly to discussing MOHPO and its relevance to the research.</li><li><b>Provide Specific Evidence:</b> In the justification, explicitly reference the specific sections or sentences in the abstract and introduction where the main claims and contributions are stated.  For example, "The main contributions, including the HHD-Ethiopic dataset and the D-MoBO approach, are outlined in the second paragraph of the introduction and the final sentences of the abstract."</li></ul></div>

It also mentions the inclusion of future work. However, the justification and the paper itself seem to lack a comprehensive discussion of limitations as recommended by the guidelines.Here are some key actionable improvements:<ul><li><b>Create a "Limitations" section:</b> Dedicate a specific section to openly discuss the limitations, rather than scattering them throughout the paper. This improves clarity and demonstrates awareness of potential weaknesses.</li><li><b>Address assumption robustness:</b> Discuss any assumptions made in the methodology and analyze how results might change if these assumptions are violated in practice. For instance, are the results sensitive to specific data distributions or model architectures?</li><li><b>Reflect on the scope of claims:</b>  Acknowledge the limitations of the datasets and experimental setup. Are the results generalizable to other historical Ethiopic manuscripts or OCR tasks?  How many runs were conducted and how consistent were the results?</li><li><b>Discuss factors influencing performance:</b> Analyze potential factors that could negatively affect model performance. For example, how do variations in image quality, script style, or character frequencies impact the OCR accuracy?</li><li><b>Computational efficiency:</b> Include a discussion on the computational requirements of the proposed methods, especially their scalability with increasing dataset sizes.</li></ul></div>

The paper primarily focuses on empirical results related to Ethiopic OCR and introduces a novel dataset. There is no evidence of theoretical results such as theorems, lemmas, or proofs within the provided text.However, there are potential areas for improvement, even without theoretical results:<ul><li><b>Formalize Evaluation Metrics:</b> While the paper discusses metrics like CER and NED, their formal definitions and calculations are not presented.

A more in-depth analysis and discussion of these patterns, potentially with visualizations or qualitative examples, would strengthen the paper and provide insights into model behavior.</li><li><b>Hyperparameter Optimization Details:</b> The paper mentions the use of hyperparameter optimization for some models but lacks specifics about the methods and search spaces.
