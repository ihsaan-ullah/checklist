","## Feedback on Answer to Question Regarding Main Claims

The author's proposed answer and justification seem partially correct but require more specific evidence to support their claims.

**Discrepancies and Issues:**

* **Justification Lacks Specificity:** While the justification mentions the introduction and abstract summarizing the paper, it  doesn't pinpoint the exact sections or sentences containing the main claims and contributions.
* **Abstract Focus:** The abstract primarily discusses multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MoBO) and its challenges, with only a brief mention of the HHD-Ethiopic dataset in the final sentences.  This creates a disconnect as the dataset is a significant contribution of the paper but receives minimal attention in the abstract.
* **Introduction Focus:** Similar to the abstract, the introduction heavily focuses on MOHPO, dedicating only a small portion to the HHD-Ethiopic dataset and its significance. 

**Actionable Feedback:**

* **Improve Abstract Balance:** Revise the abstract to give more prominence to the HHD-Ethiopic dataset.  Clearly state its purpose, size, and key characteristics. Ensure the abstract accurately reflects the balance between MOHPO and the dataset as presented in the paper.
* **Enhance Introduction Structure:** Restructure the introduction to provide a more balanced overview. Begin by introducing the importance of Ethiopic OCR and the challenges of limited datasets. Then, transition smoothly to discussing MOHPO and its relevance to the research.
* **Provide Specific Evidence:** In the justification, explicitly reference the specific sections or sentences in the abstract and introduction where the main claims and contributions are stated.  For example, ""The main contributions, including the HHD-Ethiopic dataset and the D-MoBO approach, are outlined in the second paragraph of the introduction and the final sentences of the abstract.""

Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?,Limitations,Yes,"We acknowledged in the annotation process that some annotators anonymously shared information, despite our efforts to ensure data confidentiality. Additionally, we acknowledge that our limited computational resources did not allow us to conduct extensive experiments. We also indicate some future work in the conclusion.","If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
","## Feedback on Limitations Discussion

The proposed justification mentions acknowledging limitations related to data confidentiality in the annotation process and computational resources for experiments. It also mentions the inclusion of future work. However, the justification and the paper itself seem to lack a comprehensive discussion of limitations as recommended by the guidelines.

Here are some key actionable improvements:

* **Create a ""Limitations"" section:** Dedicate a specific section to openly discuss the limitations, rather than scattering them throughout the paper. This improves clarity and demonstrates awareness of potential weaknesses.
* **Address assumption robustness:** Discuss any assumptions made in the methodology and analyze how results might change if these assumptions are violated in practice. For instance, are the results sensitive to specific data distributions or model architectures?
* **Reflect on the scope of claims:**  Acknowledge the limitations of the datasets and experimental setup. Are the results generalizable to other historical Ethiopic manuscripts or OCR tasks?  How many runs were conducted and how consistent were the results?
* **Discuss factors influencing performance:** Analyze potential factors that could negatively affect model performance. For example, how do variations in image quality, script style, or character frequencies impact the OCR accuracy?
* **Computational efficiency:** Include a discussion on the computational requirements of the proposed methods, especially their scalability with increasing dataset sizes.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer of ""NA"" with the justification ""Our paper does not include any theory"" appears accurate based on the provided paper excerpt. The paper primarily focuses on empirical results related to Ethiopic OCR and introduces a novel dataset. There is no evidence of theoretical results such as theorems, lemmas, or proofs within the provided text.

However, there are potential areas for improvement, even without theoretical results:

* **Formalize Evaluation Metrics:** While the paper discusses metrics like CER and NED, their formal definitions and calculations are not presented. Providing these details, potentially in an appendix, would enhance clarity and reproducibility. 
* **Analysis of Error Patterns:**  The paper briefly mentions distinct error patterns between human and model predictions. A more in-depth analysis and discussion of these patterns, potentially with visualizations or qualitative examples, would strengthen the paper and provide insights into model behavior.
* **Hyperparameter Optimization Details:** The paper mentions the use of hyperparameter optimization for some models but lacks specifics about the methods and search spaces. Including these details, even in the appendix, would improve reproducibility and benefit other researchers.

In section 4.2 we provide the settings for the Baseline OCR models.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
    - If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
    - If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
    - If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
    - We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

","## Feedback on Reproducibility Answer

The provided justification for claiming reproducibility focuses solely on model settings, which is insufficient. While stating model settings (Section 3.2 and 4.2) is important, it doesn't guarantee reproducibility of the main experimental results. 

Here's how to improve the paper's quality regarding reproducibility:

*   **Data Details:**  The paper lacks crucial information about the HHD-Ethiopic dataset creation process, such as the criteria for inclusion/exclusion of text-line images, preprocessing steps (beyond mentioning OCRopus), and the annotation procedure.  Provide more details on the data collection process,  including aspects like data cleaning, normalization, and any potential biases.
*   **Human Evaluation Protocol:**  The process for human evaluation needs further clarification.  How were annotators selected and trained?  What were the instructions provided to them?  Specify the evaluation metrics (CER and NED) and their calculation methods.
*   **Code Availability:** While not mandatory, releasing the code used for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation would significantly improve reproducibility and allow other researchers to verify the results. Consider including the code in the provided GitHub repository or another publicly accessible platform.

The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The provided answer and justification seem mostly correct but could benefit from a few improvements for clarity and adherence to the guidelines:

*   **Specificity**: While the justification mentions the GitHub link and the appendix, it would be more helpful to point to specific sections within the appendix (e.g., ""Appendix B.1"") that detail the data collection procedures and dataset datasheet.
*   **Reproducibility**:  The justification should explicitly state whether scripts for reproducing baseline results are included alongside the proposed method's scripts.  If only a subset is available, clarify which ones and why. 
*   **Anonymity**: Since the paper is submitted for anonymous review, ensure the GitHub repository and any linked materials are anonymized as per NeurIPS guidelines.

## Suggested Improvements

1.  **Refine Justification**:  Modify the justification to explicitly mention the relevant appendix sections and clarify the availability of baseline reproduction scripts:

> ""We provide the dataset description and open-source implementation details at https://github.com/ethopic/hhd-ethiopic-I. Users can reproduce the results by following the information provided at this link.  Details on data collection procedures and the dataset datasheet are available in Appendix B.1.

","## Feedback on Paper Checklist Answer

The authors claim to have provided all necessary training and test details in Section 4.2. However, upon reviewing the ""Paper"" excerpt, some crucial information seems to be missing or unclear:

* **Data Splits:** While the paper mentions the existence of training and test sets (including IID and OOD settings), it lacks specific details on the split ratios and the exact criteria for dividing the data. 
* **Hyperparameter Choices:** The paper discusses the importance of hyperparameter optimization but doesn't explicitly state the final chosen hyperparameters for the baseline models or the human-level performance evaluation.
* **Optimizer Type:**  The type of optimizer used for training the models is not mentioned in the provided excerpt.  
* **Training Details:**  Information about the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate schedule, and any data augmentation techniques used is missing.

## Actionable Feedback

1. **Clearly state the data split ratios for both training and test sets (IID and OOD) in Section 4.2.** This will allow for reproducibility and better understanding of the experimental setup.
2. **Provide a table summarizing the final hyperparameters used for each baseline model.** Additionally, clarify if any specific hyperparameter tuning was performed for the human-level performance evaluation. 
3. **Specify the type of optimizer used for training the models.** This is essential information for understanding the optimization process.

While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
","## Feedback on Error Bars Reporting

The author's proposed answer and justification are not aligned with the paper's content and the guidelines. While Figure 5 is mentioned, it only presents box-whisker plots without any explanation about their calculation or interpretation as error bars. 

Here's how to improve the paper:

*   **Clarify Figure 5:** Explain if the box-whisker plots are intended to represent error bars. If so, specify what they capture (e.g., standard deviation, standard error) and the factors of variability considered. 
*   **Error Bar Calculation:** Detail the method used to calculate the error bars, whether it's a closed-form formula, a library function, or a bootstrapping technique.
*   **Assumptions and Distributions:** State any assumptions made about the error distribution (e.g., normality) and address potential issues with asymmetric distributions. 
*   **Textual Explanation:** Add a section in the text explaining the error bars and referencing Figure 5. This should link the data visualization with the statistical significance of the findings.

While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
","## Feedback on Societal Impact Discussion

The provided ""Paper"" and ""Justification"" have critical issues regarding the discussion of societal impact:

* **Missing Negative Impacts:** The paper and justification only mention positive societal impacts. It's crucial to consider and discuss potential negative impacts, even if the authors believe they are unlikely or minimal. 
* **Justification Discrepancy:** The justification claims all impacts are positive, which directly contradicts the guideline's expectation for discussing both positive and negative impacts.

### Actionable Improvements:

1. **Identify Potential Negative Impacts:** Thoroughly analyze potential misuse scenarios, biases, privacy concerns, and unintended consequences of the technology. This analysis should consider both intended use cases with incorrect results and scenarios of intentional misuse. 
2. **Discuss Mitigation Strategies:**  For each identified negative impact, propose mitigation strategies. These could involve responsible data collection practices, fairness-aware training methods, privacy-preserving techniques, or mechanisms to detect and prevent misuse.
3. **Revise Justification:**  Rewrite the justification to accurately reflect the discussion of both positive and negative societal impacts within the paper. Point to specific sections where these discussions occur.

**Issues:**

* **Missing Documentation Location:** While the justification mentions an appendix and datasheet with details, it fails to specify the exact sections or appendices containing the relevant information. 
* **Unclear Asset Type:** The response assumes the ""new assets"" refer to the HHD-Ethiopic dataset. However, the paper also mentions code and models. It's unclear if documentation exists for these assets and where it is located. 
* **Data Collection Consent:** The paper briefly mentions volunteer annotators but does not explicitly discuss consent procedures, particularly concerning the sensitive nature of historical manuscripts. 

**Recommendations:**

1. **Specify Documentation Location:** Clearly indicate the appendix or datasheet section(s) providing details about the HHD-Ethiopic dataset. For example, ""Appendix B.1 provides detailed statistics about the HHD-Ethiopic dataset, while Appendix A discusses the Ethiopic writing system and data collection procedures.""
2. **Address Other Assets:**  If documentation exists for the code and models, specify its location. If not, consider creating documentation or clarifying that these assets are not publicly released. 
3. **Clarify Data Collection Consent:** Elaborate on the consent process for data collection, especially regarding the use of historical manuscripts and the involvement of high-school volunteers. Addressing ethical considerations and data privacy concerns is crucial.

The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. 
According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer of ""NA"" with the justification ""There were no crowdsourcing experiments conducted"" appears accurate based on the provided paper excerpt. The paper focuses on developing a multi-objective hyperparameter optimization algorithm and creating a historical handwritten dataset for Ethiopic OCR. There is no indication of any crowdsourcing or human subject research involved in the paper's contributions.

However, there is one potential area for improvement:

*   **Volunteer Annotation:** The paper mentions that the dataset was annotated by a team of volunteer high school students without compensation. This raises ethical concerns, especially considering the NeurIPS Code of Ethics which mandates fair compensation for data collection efforts. 

**Actionable Improvements:**

1.  **Address Ethical Concerns:** The authors should clarify the ethical considerations regarding the use of volunteer annotators. If possible, they should consider providing appropriate compensation to the students who contributed to the dataset creation. 
2.  **Transparency:**  Even though not directly related to the question, enhancing transparency by providing more details about the data collection process in the appendix would strengthen the paper. This could include information on:
    *   The process of obtaining consent from the students and their parents/guardians (if applicable).
    *   Measures taken to ensure the quality and consistency of the annotations (e.g., training, guidelines).

The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. 
We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. 
For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The proposed answer and justification seem accurate. The paper focuses on developing a dataset and evaluating OCR models for historical Ethiopic manuscripts. There is no indication of research involving human subjects or crowdsourcing. 

Therefore, the answer ""NA"" with the justification ""This is not needed for this work"" is appropriate.

### Potential Improvements 

While the answer to the checklist question is accurate, there are a couple of minor improvements for clarity:

*   **Explicitly state the absence of human subject research:** To avoid any ambiguity, consider adding a brief sentence in the paper explicitly stating that the research did not involve human subjects or require IRB approval. This could be placed in the ethics statement or a relevant section like the data collection description.
*   **Mention data privacy considerations:** Even though the data comes from historical manuscripts, it's good practice to mention any steps taken to ensure data privacy and anonymity, especially if the dataset is publicly released.
