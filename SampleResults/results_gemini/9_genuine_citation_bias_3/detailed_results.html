The abstract claims detection of bias "in both venues we consider," which may be accurate but could be overclaiming generalizability.</li></ul><h3>Actionable Improvements</h3><ol><li> <b>Reference Specific Sections:</b>  Revise the justification to explicitly reference the sections within the introduction and abstract where the main claims and contributions are stated. This demonstrates clarity and adherence to guidelines.</li><li> <b>Address Generalizability:</b> In the discussion section, explicitly analyze the extent to which the observed citation bias in the two conferences can be generalized to other venues and research areas. Discuss limitations and potential variations across different communities.</li><li> <b>Moderate Claim Strength (Optional):</b> Consider revising the abstract to slightly moderate the claim about detecting bias.

However, several aspects could be expanded upon for a more comprehensive analysis:<ul><li><b>Genuinely Present Citations:</b> While the justification for not explicitly addressing this factor is reasonable, acknowledging its potential impact on the observed effect would strengthen the discussion. Consider adding a sentence or two on how controlling for this factor might affect the results.</li><li><b>Fidelity of Citation Relationship:</b> The paper thoroughly addresses the concerns regarding false positives and negatives in identifying cited reviewers. However, it would be beneficial to briefly mention the potential impact of misidentified citations on the estimated effect size.</li><li><b>Generalizability:</b> The paper acknowledges the limitations of generalizability for the EC 2021 data due to the intervention in the assignment process. Consider expanding on the potential implications of this for the overall conclusions, particularly in comparison to the ICML 2020 results.</li><li><b>Reviewer Identity Correlations:</b>  The paper clarifies the assumption of independence among evaluations by the same reviewer and acknowledges the potential for spurious correlations.

However, Section 3 primarily describes the experimental setup and analysis of citation bias, not the specific details required for reproducing the results.Here are some key areas of improvement to ensure reproducibility:<ul><li><b>Data Availability:</b> The paper analyzes data from ICML 2020 and EC 2021. While referencing these conferences provides context, it doesn't offer access to the data itself. The authors should clarify whether the data can be publicly shared and, if so, provide clear instructions on how to access it. If data sharing isn't possible due to privacy concerns, the authors should explore alternative avenues such as releasing anonymized or aggregated datasets.</li><li><b>Code Availability:</b> The paper mentions custom parsing tools and statistical analysis methods. Sharing the code for these tools would significantly improve reproducibility. This allows other researchers to understand the specific implementation details and conduct their own analyses. If code sharing isn't feasible, the authors should provide detailed descriptions of the algorithms and methodologies employed.</li><li><b>Reviewer Expertise Metrics:</b> The paper relies on measures of reviewer expertise for the analysis. While the authors describe the general approach (e.g., self-reported expertise, textual overlap), more specific details are needed. This includes explaining how textual overlap is calculated, what specific questions were used to assess self-reported expertise, and how these measures were combined for the analysis.</li><li><b>Data Filtering Process:</b> The paper mentions excluding certain submissions based on missing data or potential confounding factors. The authors should provide a comprehensive list of exclusion criteria and justify their choices. This ensures transparency and allows other researchers to replicate the data filtering process accurately.</li></ul></div>

If there are no foreseeable risks, clearly state this.</li><li> <b>Explicitly state IRB approval:</b>  Move the statement about obtaining IRB approval from the acknowledgments to the main body of the paper, preferably within the section discussing potential risks.  Avoid mentioning the specific institution to maintain anonymity.</li></ol><h3>Score</h3></div>
