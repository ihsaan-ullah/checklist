","## Feedback on Paper's Alignment with Abstract and Introduction

The provided ""Paper"" and its abstract and introduction exhibit some discrepancies regarding the claims and scope. While the core topic of meta-learning from learning curves is consistently presented, certain aspects require refinement for better alignment:

* **Focus on Genetic Algorithms:** The abstract emphasizes a new approach using Genetic Algorithms, but the paper primarily discusses Reinforcement Learning and other techniques. The role of Genetic Algorithms needs clarification or the abstract should be revised to reflect the actual methods employed.
* **Challenge Design vs. Method Description:** The paper predominantly details the challenge design and results, while the abstract and introduction suggest a more in-depth exploration of the proposed meta-learning method itself. The paper should either delve deeper into the specifics of the proposed method or adjust the abstract and introduction to accurately represent the paper's focus on the challenge and its findings.
* **Scope of Contributions:** The abstract claims a ""significant step forward in the field of meta-learning,"" but the paper's primary contribution appears to be the design and execution of a challenge rather than a novel meta-learning algorithm. The language in the abstract should be moderated to reflect the actual scope of the work.

**Actionable Improvements:**

1. **Clarify the role of Genetic Algorithms:**  If Genetic Algorithms are central to the proposed method, dedicate a section to explaining their implementation and contribution. Otherwise, revise the abstract to accurately represent the employed methods (e.g., Reinforcement Learning) 
2. **Balance the content:**  Either expand on the description of the proposed meta-learning method with more technical details and analysis, or adjust the abstract and introduction to clearly state the paper's focus on the challenge design, results, and lessons learned.
3. **Refine contribution claims:** Moderate the language in the abstract to accurately reflect the scope of the work. Emphasize the value of the challenge design, the insights gained from the results, and their implications for future research in meta-learning from learning curves.

Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?,Limitations,Yes,"The limitations are discussed in the section “Lessons learned and new design"".","If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
","## Feedback on Limitations Discussion

The paper does discuss limitations, specifically in the ""Lessons learned and new design"" section. However, the discussion primarily focuses on limitations of the **challenge design** and how they were addressed in the second round. 

While acknowledging and addressing these design limitations is valuable, the paper would benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of the limitations of the **meta-learning approach itself**.  

Here are some key areas for improvement:

* **Assumptions:** The paper should explicitly state any strong assumptions made by the meta-learning algorithms and discuss their potential impact on results. This could include assumptions about the structure of learning curves, the relationship between datasets, or the generalizability of learned policies.
* **Scope of Claims:** The paper should clearly define the scope of its claims, acknowledging that the approach was tested on a specific set of datasets and algorithms.  It should discuss the potential limitations of generalizing the results to other settings.
* **Factors Influencing Performance:** The paper should analyze and discuss the key factors that influence the performance of the meta-learning approach.  This might involve analyzing the performance across different types of datasets or investigating the impact of hyperparameter choices.
* **Computational Efficiency:** The paper should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed methods and how they scale with increasing dataset size and complexity.  This is particularly important for practical applications of meta-learning. 

Adding a dedicated ""Limitations"" section would provide a clear and organized space for this discussion.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Paper Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer (""NA"") and justification (""This paper does not include theoretical results"") are consistent with the paper's content. The paper focuses on the design and results of a meta-learning challenge, primarily presenting empirical findings and analysis of participant solutions. There is no evident inclusion of theoretical results, such as theorems or formal proofs.

However, the paper could benefit from a few improvements to enhance clarity and impact:

* **Explicitly state the absence of theoretical results:** While the justification is accurate, explicitly stating this in the paper's introduction or methodology section would further clarify the paper's scope and focus for readers.
* **Strengthen the empirical analysis:** The paper could provide a more in-depth analysis of the winning solutions, including ablation studies or comparisons of specific components. This would offer deeper insights into the factors contributing to their success.
* **Discuss limitations and future work related to theoretical aspects:**  Although the current focus is empirical, acknowledging the potential for future theoretical investigations in the conclusion would broaden the paper's outlook and suggest avenues for further research.

While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
    - If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
    - If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
    - If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
    - We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

","## Feedback on Reproducibility

The paper provides a good overview of the challenge design, results, and winning solutions. However, there are some areas where the description of reproducibility could be improved:

* **Missing details on data generation**: While the paper mentions using 30 cross-domain datasets from the AutoML challenge and synthetically generated learning curves, it lacks specifics on how these were generated and pre-processed. This information is crucial for researchers aiming to replicate the results or build upon the work.
* **Limited information on baseline implementations**: The paper briefly describes the baselines used but does not provide enough detail to fully reproduce them. For example, the specific hyperparameters used for DDQN and the exact implementation details of the BOS and FT baselines are missing. 
* **Clarity on code availability**: The justification mentions code URLs but does not specify exactly which code is available. It should be explicitly stated whether the code for data generation, baseline implementations, and winning solutions is available and where it can be accessed.
* **Meta-dataset accessibility**: The paper mentions that the meta-datasets remain private on the challenge platform. While this might be acceptable for the purpose of the challenge, it limits the long-term reproducibility and impact of the research. Consider providing options for researchers to access the data under certain conditions or for specific research purposes. 

## Suggested Improvements

1. **Expand the description of data generation and pre-processing steps**: Provide details on how the cross-domain datasets were selected and pre-processed before generating the learning curves. This should include information on data cleaning, feature engineering, and any transformations applied.
2. **Provide detailed descriptions of baseline implementations**: Include the specific hyperparameters, libraries used, and any modifications made to the baseline algorithms. This will enable other researchers to replicate the baseline results and compare their own methods.
3. **Clarify code accessibility**: Explicitly state which code is available and where it can be accessed (e.g., GitHub repository, specific URLs). Ideally, the code for data generation, baseline implementations, and winning solutions should be publicly available. 
4. **Consider meta-dataset accessibility**: Explore options for providing access to the meta-datasets for research purposes. This could involve creating a data access request process or releasing a subset of the data for public use.

","## Feedback on Authors' Proposed Answer

The authors claim that the paper specifies all training and test details necessary to understand the results and point to the ""Challenge protocol"" section and public participant code as justification. However, there are discrepancies with the actual paper content:

* **Missing Hyperparameters:** While the paper mentions the use of various models like MLP and DDQN by participants, it lacks specific hyperparameter choices made by each team for their models, making it difficult to reproduce or fully understand their results.
* **Selection Strategies:** While the paper describes high-level strategies of winning solutions, it lacks details on the exact implementation of their algorithm selection and budget allocation policies.
* **Evaluation Metrics:** The paper focuses on ALC as the primary evaluation metric, but it is unclear if other metrics were used to assess performance and generalizability of the models. 

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Expand Hyperparameter Details:** Include a dedicated section or table summarizing the key hyperparameters used by each winning team, alongside their justification for those choices. This will enhance reproducibility and allow for deeper analysis of the methods.
2. **Detail Selection Strategies:** Provide more specifics about the actual implementation of the winning teams' algorithm selection and budget allocation policies. This might involve pseudocode, equations, or more elaborate descriptions of their decision-making processes.
3. **Discuss Additional Evaluation Metrics:** Consider including additional evaluation metrics beyond ALC to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the models' performance. This might include metrics for runtime, memory usage, or performance on specific subsets of datasets.

Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?,Error bars,No,We didn't explicitly discuss the error-bars.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
","## Feedback on Error Bars Reporting

The paper's current answer to the question of error bars is accurate: the paper indeed does not discuss error bars or other measures of statistical significance for the presented results. This omission hinders the paper's ability to convey the reliability and generalizability of the findings.

Here are some key actionable improvements to address this issue:

* **Compute and report error bars:** For the main results, calculate and present error bars (e.g., standard deviation or standard error of the mean) in the tables and figures. This will provide readers with a clearer understanding of the variability and uncertainty associated with the reported performance metrics. 
* **Explain error bar calculation:** Clearly describe the methodology used to compute the error bars. This could involve specifying a closed-form formula, referencing a library function, or detailing a bootstrap procedure. 
* **State assumptions:** Outline any assumptions made during the error bar calculation, such as the distribution of errors (e.g., normality assumption).
* **Clarify error bar type:** Indicate whether the error bars represent standard deviation or standard error of the mean.
* **Reference in text:**  In the text, explain how the error bars were calculated and explicitly refer to the corresponding tables and figures containing the error bars.

The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
","## Feedback on Societal Impact Discussion 

The provided paper focuses on meta-learning and its application in algorithm selection and resource allocation. While it extensively discusses the technical aspects and potential benefits within the field of machine learning, it lacks a dedicated discussion on the broader societal impacts, both positive and negative.

**Here are some actionable improvements based on the guidelines:**

* **Include a section on societal impact:**  Dedicate a section to explicitly discuss the potential societal implications of the research. This demonstrates awareness and encourages responsible development of the technology.  
* **Explore positive impacts:** Expand on the mentioned positive impacts of reduced human intervention and computational cost. Discuss how these could lead to greater accessibility of machine learning, improved efficiency in various sectors, and potential applications in critical areas like healthcare or environmental research.
* **Address potential negative impacts**:  Investigate and discuss potential negative societal impacts. For example:
    * **Bias and fairness**:  Could the meta-learning approach perpetuate or amplify biases present in the training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes? 
    * **Job displacement**:  Could the automation enabled by efficient algorithm selection lead to job displacement in certain sectors? 
    * **Misuse potential**:  Could malicious actors exploit the technology for harmful purposes, such as developing more efficient algorithms for generating deepfakes or spreading misinformation?
* **Consider mitigation strategies**: If potential negative impacts are identified, explore mitigation strategies. This could involve techniques for bias detection and correction, responsible AI development practices, or mechanisms to prevent misuse.

Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. 
Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Question

The proposed answer of ""NA"" with the justification ""Our paper poses no such risks."" is not entirely accurate. While the paper itself may not directly involve releasing data or models, the challenge it describes utilizes a meta-dataset of precomputed learning curves. This meta-dataset, although not publicly released, could potentially pose risks if mishandled or accessed by unauthorized individuals. 

Here's how the authors can improve their response and the paper:

* **Acknowledge the existence of the meta-dataset and potential risks**: Modify the answer to ""Yes"" and in the justification, specify the section describing the meta-dataset creation (e.g., ""Section 3.1 describes the creation and composition of the meta-dataset used in the challenge."").
* **Address safeguards for the meta-dataset**:  Add a section (or expand the existing one) to discuss the safeguards implemented to protect the meta-dataset. This could include:
    * **Access control measures**: Explain how access to the meta-dataset is restricted and controlled, such as through user authentication and authorization protocols on the challenge platform (Codalab).
    * **Data anonymization**: If applicable, describe any anonymization techniques applied to the meta-dataset to protect sensitive information.  
    * **Usage guidelines**: If the meta-dataset is intended for future research use, consider providing clear usage guidelines and terms of access to ensure responsible utilization.

*   **Explicitly state licenses:** For each asset (datasets, algorithms, code packages), clearly state the name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0, MIT License). 
*   **Version and URL:** Mention the version of each asset used and provide a URL or DOI for access, whenever possible.
*   **Dataset Licensing:**  
    *   For the 30 cross-domain datasets from the AutoML challenge, research and specify the license for each dataset. Resources like paperswithcode.com/datasets can be helpful.
    *   For the synthetically generated dataset, clarify its license and terms of use.
*   **Code Package Licensing:** Specify the license for any code packages used (e.g., starting kit, baselines) and clarify the terms of use.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Paper Checklist Answer

The proposed answer and justification have several discrepancies with the paper content and guidelines:

* **Justification Location:** The justification mentions the challenge website as the source of documentation for the new assets. However, the guidelines clearly state that the justification should point to specific sections within the paper itself, not external sources. 
* **Documentation within the Paper:** The paper does not seem to contain detailed documentation of the new assets (meta-datasets) within its main body or appendix. The information provided is primarily focused on the challenge design and results, not the specifics of the data itself.
* **Dataset/Code/Model Details:** The paper lacks structured information on the meta-datasets, such as training procedures, licenses, limitations, and consent acquisition. 
* **Anonymization:** The paper does not mention whether the meta-datasets were anonymized for the NeurIPS submission, as required by the guidelines. 

## Actionable Feedback

* **Document Assets within the Paper:** Dedicate a section (or appendix) to thoroughly document the new meta-datasets. This should include details about data collection, preparation, format, features,  licenses, limitations, and any ethical considerations, particularly regarding consent if human subjects were involved.
* **Structure Information:** Use structured templates or tables to present the asset information clearly and concisely.
* **Address Anonymization:**  Explicitly state whether the meta-datasets were anonymized for the NeurIPS submission and describe the anonymization process if applicable.
* **Update Justification:** Modify the justification to accurately point to the specific sections within the paper where the asset documentation can be found.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The author's proposed answer of ""NA"" with the justification ""This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects"" appears accurate based on the provided paper content. The paper focuses on meta-learning algorithms and utilizes pre-existing datasets and simulations. There is no mention of data collection involving human participants. 

However, the paper does contain a statement in the ""Software and Data"" section about one dataset involving human subjects. This creates a discrepancy and necessitates a revision to ensure clarity and transparency.

### Recommended Actions:

1. **Revise the Answer and Justification:** Change the answer to ""Yes"" and update the justification to specify the section (""Software and Data"") where information about the human subjects study is located. 
2. **Expand the Human Subjects Information:** Provide more details in the ""Software and Data"" section about the study involving human subjects. This should include information about:
    * **Study design and purpose**
    * **Data collection procedures**
    * **Sample size and demographics**
    * **Compensation provided**
    * **Ethical considerations and approvals**

3. **Consider Moving the Information:**  Depending on the significance of this human subjects study to the paper's core contributions, consider moving the detailed information to the main body of the paper (e.g., in a dedicated section or within the methodology).

Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. 
We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Paper Checklist Answer

The proposed answer and justification seem appropriate for the given question and paper content. The paper clearly focuses on a meta-learning challenge using pre-computed datasets and algorithms, without involving any direct human subject research or crowdsourcing. 

However, the justification could benefit from a slight improvement:

* **Specificity**: Instead of a generic statement, referencing the specific sections describing the datasets and methodologies would strengthen the justification. For example: ""This paper analyzes pre-computed learning curves and algorithms within a meta-learning challenge framework, as detailed in sections 3 and 4. It does not involve direct interaction or data collection from human subjects"".

## Additional Considerations

Although not directly related to the current question, here are a few potential areas for improvement based on the paper excerpt: 

* **Clarity in Abstract**: The abstract could benefit from more specific details about the proposed meta-learning approach and its key contributions, instead of general statements.
* **Visualizations**: Including visualizations of the learning curves and performance comparisons would significantly enhance the understanding and impact of the results.
* **Baseline Comparisons**: While the paper mentions baseline comparisons, providing more details on the chosen baselines and their implementations would strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method.
