Discuss potential limitations and biases related to generalizing the findings to other conferences or research fields.</li><li><b>Selection bias</b>: Acknowledge the potential for selection bias due to the opt-in nature of the study. Discuss how this might influence the results and their interpretation.</li><li><b>Hawthorne effect</b>:  Address the potential impact of the Hawthorne effect on evaluator behavior, as they were aware of participating in a study.</li><li><b>Impact of consequences</b>: Discuss how the presence of actual consequences (e.g., awards, promotions) for reviewers based on review evaluations might affect the observed behaviors and biases.</li><li><b>Dishonest behavior</b>:  While acknowledging the difficulty in studying dishonesty in this context, briefly discuss the potential for dishonest behavior (e.g., lone wolf manipulation or collusion rings) if stakes were higher.</li><li><b>Alternative evaluation methods</b>:  Expand on the suggestion of exploring semi-automated or fully automated approaches for evaluating review quality.

While having a methods section is important, it doesn't necessarily mean it contains *all* the necessary details for replicating the results.Here's how to improve the paper's response to the reproducibility question:<ul><li><b>Specificity:</b> Instead of a general statement, point to the *specific* sections within the methods and Results sections that provide details for each experiment. For example:</li></ul>* "The methods for the RCT on elongated reviews are detailed in Section 4.1.1, with the corresponding results in Section 4.1.2. The analysis of author-outcome bias is described in Section 4.2.1, with results in Section 4.2.2…"<ul><li><b>Completeness:</b> Go through each experiment and ensure the methods section includes:</li></ul>* <b>Data collection process:</b> How were the reviews and evaluations collected? Were there any inclusion/exclusion criteria?* <b>Participant demographics:</b> Who were the participants (reviewers, authors, etc.)? How many were there?* <b>Evaluation criteria:</b> What specific criteria were used to evaluate the reviews? How were these criteria defined and measured?* <b>Statistical tests:</b> What statistical tests were used to analyze the data? What were the parameters and significance levels?<ul><li><b>Software and Tools:</b> If any specific software packages or tools were used for data analysis, mention them explicitly with version numbers.</li><li><b>Openness to Data Sharing:</b> Even if not providing the data directly, state whether the authors are open to sharing the data upon request, and under what conditions. This further enhances the transparency and potential for reproducibility.</li></ul>By addressing these points, the paper can provide a more convincing and informative response to the reproducibility question, increasing its credibility and value to the research community.</div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-red "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> <h3>Feedback for NeurIPS Checklist Question</h3>The authors' proposed answer of "No" with the justification "IRB approval is not included in the text manuscript" is accurate based on the provided paper. However, the paper's content suggests it involved human subjects research. Here's how to improve the paper:<ul><li>  <b>Address IRB Approval:</b></li></ul>*   Clearly state whether IRB approval (or equivalent) was obtained for the study.*   If approval was obtained, specify the approving institution (without breaking anonymity) .*   If approval was not sought, justify why it was deemed unnecessary.*   Discuss ethical considerations and steps taken to protect participant privacy.<ul><li>  <b>Potential Risks:</b></li></ul>*   Describe any potential risks participants might have encountered (e.g., emotional distress from negative reviews).*   Explain how these risks were mitigated or if they were disclosed to participants.These additions will enhance the paper's ethical transparency and clarity.</div>
