This is a crucial aspect highlighted in the guidelines.</li></ul><h3>Actionable Feedback:</h3><ol><li> <b>Improve justification:</b> Modify the justification to explicitly reference the sections where the main claims and scope are discussed. For example: "The abstract and introduction clearly outline the paper's contributions (Section 1) and scope (Sections 1 and 3), specifically addressing the problem of deanonymization due to batching in pseudonymous forums and proposing a novel one-sided differential privacy mechanism with a zero-inflated uniform delay."</li><li> <b>Discuss assumptions and limitations:</b> Add a paragraph to the Introduction discussing the assumptions and limitations of the proposed approach. This may include aspects such as the reliance on users accurately reporting batching behaviour and the potential reordering of events with the zero-inflated uniform mechanism.</li><li> <b>Consider implications and future work:</b> Briefly discuss the implications of the findings and potential future work addressing the limitations, such as handling dependencies between events and exploring alternative mechanisms that preserve order.</li></ol></div>

While Section 7 mentions future work, it doesn't delve into the potential weaknesses or constraints of the current work. This is a crucial aspect of any research paper, as it demonstrates the authors' awareness of the boundaries and potential pitfalls of their methods.Here are some actionable suggestions to improve the paper by addressing limitations:<ul><li><b>Create a "Limitations" Section:</b> Dedicate a section specifically to discussing limitations. This improves readability and signals to reviewers that the authors have thoughtfully considered the limitations.</li><li><b>Discuss Assumptions:</b> The paper makes assumptions about user behavior and batching patterns. Discuss the robustness of the results if these assumptions are violated (e.g., non-uniform batching intervals, coordinated behavior).</li><li><b>Scope of Claims:</b>  The paper analyzes specific datasets (peer review, Wikipedia, Bitcoin).

For example, enhanced anonymity might encourage participation from diverse groups who previously feared privacy risks. This could lead to more inclusive and representative platforms.</li><li><b>Expand on mitigation strategies:</b> The paper briefly mentions mitigation strategies but could dedicate a more thorough discussion to them.
