This contradicts the claim that "Our research does not involve human subjects or ethical issues."</li><li>  The statement regarding "countless undergraduate students" and "underpaid crowdworkers" raises ethical concerns about fair compensation and acknowledgment for their contributions.

If the data cannot be fully anonymized, consider discussing potential risks and mitigation strategies or revise the claim of no ethical involvement.</li><li>  <b>Address Ethical Concerns:</b>  Acknowledge the contributions of undergraduate students and crowdworkers, ensuring appropriate credit and compensation for their work. If these contributions were significant to the research, consider including them as co-authors or in the acknowledgments section.</li></ol></div>
