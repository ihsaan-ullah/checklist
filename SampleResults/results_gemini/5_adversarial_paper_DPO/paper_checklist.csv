It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper. 
","## Discrepancies and Actionable Feedback:

*   **Missing Specific Section References:** While the justification claims accurate reflection of contributions and scope, it fails to point to specific sections within the paper as evidence, as required by the guidelines. 
*   **Vague Claims:** The abstract and introduction contain general statements about RLHF and its benefits but lack specific details about the paper's unique contributions, such as the introduction of the DPO algorithm and its advantages over existing RLHF approaches.
*   **Assumptions and Limitations Absent:** The abstract and introduction do not mention any assumptions or limitations of the proposed approach, which are crucial for understanding the scope and generalizability of the research findings.

## Suggested Improvements:

1.  **Enhance Justification:** Modify the justification to explicitly reference specific sections (e.g., Section 4, Section 6.2) where the main claims about DPO, its efficiency, and performance are discussed.
2.  **Clarify Contributions in Abstract:** Revise the abstract to highlight the key contribution of the paper, namely the DPO algorithm, and its ability to achieve RLHF objectives without explicit reward modeling or reinforcement learning.
3.  **Include Assumptions/Limitations:** Add a paragraph to the introduction discussing the assumptions made during the development of DPO and potential limitations of the approach. This could include the types of tasks or datasets where DPO is most effective, computational considerations, or potential biases.

Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?,Limitations,Yes,"Limitations are discussed in “Limitations & Future Work"" section.","If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
","## Feedback on Limitations Discussion

While the paper mentions the importance of supervised learning and its advantages for language models, it falls short of discussing the limitations of the DPO approach itself.  

Here are some key areas needing improvement:

* **Scope of claims:** The paper primarily evaluates DPO on sentiment modification, summarization, and dialogue tasks.  It should explicitly state whether these results generalize to other tasks or domains.  Additionally, discuss the limitations of using GPT-4 as a proxy for human evaluation.
* **Comparison to baselines:**  The paper presents win rates against baselines but doesn't delve into scenarios where DPO might underperform or exhibit weaknesses compared to other methods.  Analyze and discuss these situations.
* **Robustness and assumptions:**  The paper mentions the importance of the KL-divergence constraint but doesn't explore the impact of different constraint strengths or potential biases introduced by the reference policy.  Additionally, discuss the sensitivity of DPO to the quality and quantity of preference data.
* **Computational efficiency:**  While DPO avoids the RL training phase, it's unclear how its computational cost compares to RLHF during inference, especially with large language models.  Provide a comparison of the computational requirements.
* **Privacy and fairness:**   Discuss potential biases or fairness issues arising from the preference data or the DPO training process.  Consider the implications of using human preferences, which might reflect societal biases.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Paper Checklist Answer

The proposed ""Answer"" and ""Justification"" have some discrepancies with the ""Paper"" content and the ""Guidelines"" for the question regarding theoretical results.

**Issues:** 

* **Missing Proof Sketch:** While the paper mentions theoretical results in Sections 4, 5, and Appendix A, it does not provide a proof sketch in the main body for the key theoretical result (Theorem 1). The ""Guidelines"" recommend including a  sketch to provide intuition when full proofs are in the supplemental material. 
* **Unclear Assumption Clarity:**  The paper does not explicitly state that all assumptions are clearly stated or referenced within the theorems themselves. While the provided sections likely contain this information, the justification lacks specific confirmation.

**Actionable Improvements:**

1. **Include Proof Sketch for Theorem 1:** Add a concise proof sketch for Theorem 1 in the main body of the paper, summarizing the key steps and intuition behind the proof located in Appendix A.6. This will enhance the accessibility and understanding of the theoretical contribution for readers.

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
    - If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
    - If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
    - If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
    - We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

","## Feedback on Reproducibility Claim 

The provided ""Paper"" discusses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), a new method for training language models from preferences without relying on reinforcement learning. While the authors claim full disclosure of information for reproducing the main experimental results, there are some areas where the justification falls short or lacks clarity:

* **Specifics of DPO Implementation:** While the justification points to Section 6 and Appendices B, C, and D, it would be beneficial to explicitly mention the implementation details crucial for reproducing results. This includes the specific hyperparameters used (e.g., β value), optimizer settings, learning rate schedules, and any data augmentation or preprocessing steps.
* **Training Infrastructure Details:**  For researchers aiming to replicate the results, understanding the computational resources and environment is vital. The paper should mention the hardware used (e.g., GPUs) and software frameworks (e.g., PyTorch version).
* **Evaluation Procedure Clarity:** Although Section 6.2 mentions GPT-4 as a proxy for human evaluation, the paper should provide more details on the evaluation procedure. This includes the specific prompts used for GPT-4, the rationale for choosing those prompts, and the method for calculating win rates. 
* **Baseline Implementation Details:** The paper compares DPO to several baselines, including PPO and Best-of-N sampling. To ensure reproducibility, it's essential to clarify the implementation details and hyperparameter choices for these baseline methods as well. 

**Actionable Improvements:**

1. **Expand Section 6 and Appendices:**  Include a dedicated subsection explicitly outlining the hyperparameters, training infrastructure, and evaluation procedures. Provide the exact GPT-4 prompts used for evaluation and the rationale behind their selection.
2. **Open-Source Code (Optional):**  While not mandatory for NeurIPS, releasing the code would significantly enhance reproducibility and allow researchers to directly experiment with DPO. 
3. **Clarify Baseline Implementations:**  Provide a table or appendix section detailing the specific implementation details and hyperparameters used for each baseline method.

The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The proposed answer and justification seem accurate at first glance. However, after carefully examining the paper, there are some potential areas for improvement to ensure the reproducibility of the results:

* **Clarity on Data Access:** Section 6 and Appendix B & C  should explicitly state how to access the raw data for each experiment (e.g., IMDB, TL;DR, Anthropic HH). Providing URLs or specific instructions to access the data would enhance clarity.
* **Data Preparation Scripts:**  The paper mentions using preprocessed data (e.g., IMDB) and fine-tuned models (e.g., GPT-J).  Instructions or scripts for preprocessing  the raw data  and replicating the fine-tuning process should be included to ensure full reproducibility.
* **Baseline Implementation Details:** While DPO's implementation details are provided, similar information for  baselines like PPO and Unlikelihood (hyperparameters, architecture, etc.)  should be included to accurately reproduce the comparative results.
* **Computational Requirements:**  Consider specifying the hardware and software environment used to run the experiments. This helps researchers gauge the feasibility of reproducing the results and understand the computational cost involved. 

## Recommendations for Improvement

1. **Enhance Data Access Instructions:** Provide clear and specific instructions on how to access the raw data for each experiment, including URLs or data repository references.
2. **Include Data Preprocessing Scripts:** Supply scripts or detailed instructions for preprocessing the raw data into the format used by DPO and baseline methods.
3. **Document Baseline Implementations:** Offer implementation details for the baseline methods, including hyperparameters, network architectures, and any modifications made to existing algorithms. 
4. **Specify Computational Environment:** Detail the hardware (e.g., GPU type and number) and software environment (e.g., libraries and versions) used to run the experiments. 

## Conclusion

Addressing these issues will significantly improve the reproducibility of the paper's results and enhance its overall quality. While the core components for reproducibility seem present, the additional clarity and details will benefit researchers attempting to replicate the work.

","## Analysis of Author's Proposed Answer and Justification

The ""Paper"" section provides an overview of RLHF but doesn't seem to contain the specific details about the training and test setup as required by the question. Therefore, the proposed answer of ""Yes"" is likely incorrect.

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
","## Feedback on Error Bar Reporting

The provided paper discusses Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for training language models, comparing its performance to RLHF methods. While the justification points to sections 6 and Appendix B and C, these sections primarily focus on experimental setups, results, and implementation details. They do not seem to offer a clear explanation of error bars or statistical significance measures used in the experiments.

Here's how to improve the paper's reporting of error bars and statistical significance:

*   **Identify Variability Factors**: Clearly state which sources of variability the error bars capture (e.g., train/test split, initialization, random sampling).
*   **Explain Error Bar Calculation**: Describe the specific method used to calculate the error bars (e.g., standard deviation, standard error, confidence intervals, bootstrap).
*   **State Assumptions**: Clarify any assumptions made during the calculation of error bars (e.g., normality of the data).
*   **Specify Error Bar Type**: Explicitly state whether the error bars represent standard deviation or standard error. It is also important to mention if 1-sigma error bars are used.
*   **Address Asymmetric Distributions**: For cases with asymmetric distributions, ensure that the visualization of error bars does not lead to out-of-range results (e.g., negative error rates).
*   **Connect Text with Tables/Figures**: If error bars are presented in tables or figures, the corresponding text should explain their calculation and reference the relevant figures/tables.

The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
","## Feedback on Societal Impact Discussion 

The provided ""Paper"" and ""Justification"" have several critical issues regarding the discussion of societal impacts:

* **Missing Positive Impacts**: While the ""Paper"" mentions the potential for RLHF to improve LLM reliability, safety, and ethical behavior, it does not explicitly discuss specific positive societal impacts. Examples could include improved accessibility for people with disabilities, enhanced education and learning tools, or more efficient and equitable resource allocation.
* **Missing Negative Impacts**: The ""Paper"" entirely neglects the potential negative societal impacts of RLHF. This is a critical omission, given the guidelines' emphasis on considering potential harms and misuse. Examples of relevant negative impacts could include:
    * **Bias and Discrimination**: RLHF systems could perpetuate or amplify existing biases present in the training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes.
    * **Misinformation and Manipulation**: Advanced LLMs trained with RLHF might be used to create highly convincing deepfakes or propaganda, exacerbating the spread of misinformation and manipulation. 
    * **Job displacement**: The increasing capabilities of RLHF-trained LLMs could automate tasks currently performed by humans, leading to job displacement in various sectors.
    * **Privacy Concerns**: RLHF systems might require access to sensitive data for training and feedback, raising privacy concerns.

* **Lack of Mitigation Strategies**:  The ""Paper"" should at least acknowledge the potential negative impacts and briefly discuss possible mitigation strategies. Examples could include developing fairness-aware training methods, implementing mechanisms for detecting and preventing misuse, or promoting transparency and user education.

## Recommendations

1. **Include a dedicated section or subsection explicitly addressing the societal impacts of RLHF**: This section should discuss both the positive and negative potential impacts, providing specific examples and elaborating on the potential consequences for individuals and society.
2. **Discuss potential mitigation strategies for the identified negative impacts**:  Explore approaches to mitigate risks and promote responsible development and deployment of RLHF technology.

","## Analysis of Author's Response to NeurIPS Checklist Question

The authors have answered ""No"" to the question of whether their paper describes safeguards for responsible release of data or models susceptible to misuse. Their justification accurately reflects the paper's content, which primarily focuses on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for training language models using human preferences. There is no mention of safeguards for model or data release.

## Recommendations for Improvement

While the authors' answer and justification are accurate, the paper could benefit from addressing potential misuse risks associated with DPO and related models. Here are a few actionable suggestions:

* **Discuss potential misuse risks:** Dedicate a section (e.g., within the discussion or limitations) to explore potential misuse scenarios related to DPO and preference-trained language models. This could include generating biased or harmful content, amplifying societal biases present in preference data, or manipulating the training process to produce desired outcomes. 
* **Explore mitigation strategies:** Following the discussion of risks, propose potential mitigation strategies. This might involve techniques for debiasing preference data, implementing fairness constraints in the training process, or developing robust human-in-the-loop systems for monitoring and controlling model outputs. 
* **Transparency and openness:**  Emphasize the importance of transparency and open communication regarding the limitations and potential risks of DPO and similar models. This could involve disclosing the source and potential biases of preference data, clearly outlining the capabilities and limitations of the trained models, and fostering public dialogue about the ethical implications of this technology.

## Conclusion

Addressing potential misuse risks and mitigation strategies would significantly enhance the paper's quality and demonstrate the authors' commitment to responsible AI development.

If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Paper Checklist Answer

The proposed answer and justification have several discrepancies with the ""Guidelines"" and the actual paper content:

**Discrepancies:**

* **Missing Specifics:** The justification vaguely mentions ""numerous citations""  but doesn't point to specific sections where license information for code, data, or models can be found as required by the guidelines.
* **Assumed ""Yes"":**  While the paper likely uses existing assets (e.g., datasets, pre-trained models), it's premature to assume a ""Yes"" without concrete evidence of proper attribution and licenses within the paper.

**Actionable Feedback:**

1. **Thorough Asset Inventory:**  Conduct a comprehensive review of the paper to identify all used assets (datasets, models, code libraries).
2. **Specific Attribution & Licenses:** For each asset:
    * **Cite the original source:**  Include the paper or website where the asset was first introduced.
    * **Specify version and URL (if possible):**  Mention the specific version used and provide a URL for access or further information.
    * **State the license clearly:**  e.g.,  ""The Reddit TL;DR dataset is used under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0)."" 
3. **Update Justification:** Point to the specific section(s) in the paper where the detailed attribution and license information for each asset can be found.

Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?,Documentation,Yes,Yes. See Appendix B.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. 
The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer and justification have some discrepancies with the paper content and guidelines:

* **Missing Asset Details**: While Appendix B is mentioned, the paper lacks specific details about the nature of the ""new assets"". Are these datasets, models, code, or something else? The justification should clearly state the type of asset and its purpose. 
* **Documentation Location**: The justification should explicitly state whether the documentation is directly included in Appendix B or if it points to an external resource. 
* **Anonymization**: The guidelines emphasize anonymizing assets during submission. The authors should clarify if and how the assets are anonymized.
* **Consent**: The paper doesn't mention whether consent was obtained for using assets involving people. This is crucial for ethical considerations.

### Actionable Feedback:

1. **Clarify Asset Type and Purpose**: Specify the type of new asset(s) introduced in the paper and its/their role in the research within the justification.  
2. **Documentation Details**: Clearly state where the documentation can be found (e.g., within Appendix B or via an external link) and what information it contains.
3. **Address Anonymization**: Explain how the assets are anonymized to comply with submission guidelines.
4. **Consent Discussion**: If applicable, discuss how consent was obtained from individuals whose data or contributions are included in the assets.

"For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?",Human subjects,Yes,See Appendix D.3.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. 
According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. 
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer of ""Yes"" and justification referencing Appendix D.3 seem **inconsistent** with the provided paper excerpt. The paper primarily focuses on the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) algorithm for RLHF, with no clear indication of crowdsourcing experiments or human subject research within the main text. 

Here's the itemized feedback for improvement:

*   **Clarify Human Involvement:** If the research involved human subjects for data collection or annotation (e.g., generating preferences), explicitly state this in the main paper. Briefly describe the tasks, participant demographics, and compensation details. 
*   **Move Relevant Information to Main Paper:**  Shift the full instructions, screenshots, and compensation details from Appendix D.3 to a dedicated section in the main paper. 
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Address ethical aspects of human involvement, ensuring compliance with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics on fair compensation.

Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. 
We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. 
For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
","## Feedback on NeurIPS Checklist Answer

The authors' proposed answer (""No"") and justification accurately reflect the content of the paper. The paper does involve human subjects but lacks any mention of IRB approval or risk assessment for participants.

Here are some suggestions for improvement:

* **Clearly state whether IRB approval (or equivalent) was obtained.** This information should be included in the paper, ideally in a dedicated Ethics Statement or within the paper's methodology section.  
* **If applicable, describe the potential risks incurred by study participants.**  This could involve risks to privacy, psychological well-being, or other factors depending on the specifics of the study.  
* **Explain how these risks were mitigated or addressed.**  If IRB approval was not obtained, provide a justification based on the guidelines of the author's institution or country.
