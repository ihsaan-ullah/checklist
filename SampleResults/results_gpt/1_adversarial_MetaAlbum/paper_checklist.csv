Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope?,Claims,No,We haven't mentioned the main claims in the abstract and introduction,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper.
The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. 
The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. 
It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.

Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors?,Limitations,Yes,We have clearly explained the limitations of our work in Section: Discussion and conclusion,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. 
The authors are encouraged to create a separate ""Limitations"" section in their paper.
The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?,Experiments reproducibility,No,We have tried to detail all the experiments details but we cannot make public our code and experiment details for reproducibility,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. 
Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example
    - If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm.
    - If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully.
    - If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).
    - We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

"Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?",Code and data accessibility,No,Our work is proprietary and we are not making the code and data available for public,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so “No” is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

"Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?",Experimental settings/details,Yes,We have explained the experimental settings or details in Section 3.2: Experiments.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
","
The provided ""Answer"" and ""Justification"" have significant discrepancies with the requirements for answering the NeurIPS conference submission checklist question regarding the specification of all training and test details. The authors claim to explain the experimental settings in Section 3.2 of their paper; however, the extensive review of the paper content provided does not include explicit mentions or details in Section 3.2 or any section regarding:

1. Data splits (training, validation, and test) specifically for their experiments.
2. The precise choice of hyperparameters and their rationale.
3. Details on the type of optimizer used for training the models.

Actionable feedback based on the guidelines:

1. **Specify Data Splits**: Clearly articulate how the data was divided into training, validation, and testing sets. If certain datasets were used for specific tasks, like meta-training and meta-testing, this needs to be explicitly stated, including any specifics about class or dataset partitioning strategies to avoid data leakage and ensure fair evaluation.

2. **Hyperparameter Details**: Provide a detailed description of all hyperparameters used in the experiments. This includes learning rates, batch sizes, any form of regularization (e.g., dropout rates), and other model-specific parameters. If a range of values was explored, summarize the exploration process and justify the final choice of hyperparameters used to report results.

3. **Optimizer Information**: Clearly identify the type of optimizer (e.g., SGD, Adam) used in the experiments. Additionally, provide details about any optimizer-specific parameters like momentum or epsilon values. If different optimizers were used in different experiments or for different models, clarify these choices and provide justifications.

4. **Supplemental Details**: While the main paper should include all critical experimental details to understand the results, additional information such as extensive hyperparameter searches, ablation studies, or any data preprocessing steps can be moved to supplemental material if space is a constraint. Ensure that directions to the supplemental material are clear for readers.

5. **Reproducibility**: Include information about the computational resources used (e.g., type of GPUs, CPU environments) and average training times if relevant, to give readers an understanding of the computational overhead of the proposed methods.

6. **Versioning of Datasets and Code**: Indicate the version of any external datasets used, and provide access or reference to the exact version of your own dataset (Meta-Album) used in the experiments. Additionally, provide a link to the repository containing the source code used for the experiments, ensuring it is well-documented for complete reproducibility.

These improvements are crucial for ensuring the scientific rigor and reproducibility of the results presented in the paper, aligning with the NeurIPS guidelines for clear and detailed reporting of experimental methodologies.",0
Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?,Error bars,Yes,We have reported error bars in Section 3.2: Experiments.,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
The authors should answer ""Yes"" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?,Impacts,Yes,We have detailed potential impacts and recommended use in Section 1.3,"If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").

The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

"Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?",Safeguards,Yes,"Indeed, we are releasing our datasets with proper license and terms of use. We have also provided recommended usage of these datasets.","If you answer Yes to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.
While ""Yes"" is generally preferable to ""No"", it is perfectly acceptable to answer ""No"" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., ""error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive"" or ""we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"").
""
The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. 
Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

The provided detailed information, while comprehensive and informative on various aspects of the Meta-Album project, its datasets, the preparation process, and comparison with other datasets, does not correspond to the format of an answer to a specific checklist question regarding the description of potential risks to study participants, disclosure of such risks, and whether IRB approval was obtained, as anticipated by the guideline question. Thus, actionable feedback to address this specific question from the checklist and improve the paper quality in line with the guidelines cannot be provided based on the submitted content. 

For significant improvements:

1. **Clearly Address the Checklist Question**: The response must directly address the question concerning ethical considerations, potential risks to participants, risk disclosures, and IRB approvals. This necessitates mentioning sections in the paper where such discussions can be found, or explicitly noting these considerations if not applicable.
   
2. **Ethical Considerations and Participants' Risks**: If the study involved human participants or data derived from human subjects (including indirectly, such as through social media datasets), clearly outline any potential ethical considerations. Discuss the steps taken to mitigate risks to participants, ensuring privacy and security of personal data, especially if the data used could potentially be traced back to individuals.

3. **IRB Approval or Equivalent Ethical Review**: If applicable, include a statement regarding the IRB review and approval process. If the study does not involve human subjects research or if the datasets used are publicly available and considered exempt from IRB review, provide a justification. This justification should reference the specific criteria under which the study was deemed exempt.

4. **Anonymity and Data Handling**: Highlight measures taken to ensure the anonymity and privacy of any data subjects. Discuss data handling protocols, especially in cases where datasets are pooled from different sources, to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.

5. **Data Source and License Compliance**: Verify and clearly state the licenses of the datasets used and their compliance with ethical guidelines for research use. This should address any potential issues of copyright, consent, and permissible use.

6. **Accessible and Inclusive Research Practice**: Ensure that the paper discusses how the datasets and methodologies employed support ethical and inclusive research practices. Where applicable, discuss the representativeness of datasets and steps taken to avoid bias.

The emphasis should be on demonstrating due diligence in ethical considerations, responsible data handling, and compliance with regulatory and institutional review standards, aligned with the core objective of promoting ethical research practices in the AI and machine learning community.
