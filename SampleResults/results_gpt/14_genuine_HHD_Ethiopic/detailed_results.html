However, the justification provided doesn't specifically point to the sections where these limitations are discussed in detail as required by the guidelines. The authors mention acknowledging limitations related to the annotation process, computational resources, and future work in the conclusion but do not provide section numbers or specific references within the paper, which makes it difficult to verify the claims directly.<br><b>Actionable Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Specific References:</b> Amend the justification to include specific section numbers or headings where the limitations are discussed. This will greatly aid in locating and understanding the context and details of the limitations mentioned.</li><br><li> <b>Expansion of Limitations:</b> If not already done, consider creating a separate subsection within the Conclusion or Discussion sections specifically dedicated to limitations. This should encapsulate the points raised in the justification (annotator anonymity issues, computational resource limitations, and areas identified for future work), in addition to any other potential limitations related to the assumptions, scope, methodology, or data. Clearly delineating these points helps in transparency and sets the stage for future improvements.</li><br><li> <b>Discuss Robustness and Scope:</b> Reflect further on how the limitations impact the robustness of the results and the generalizability of the model beyond the current dataset or tasks. This could involve discussing how the limitations might affect the application of the model to other scripts, languages, or historical document analysis tasks.</li><br><li> <b>Impact of Limitations:</b> Elaborate on the potential consequences of these limitations on the findings and interpretation of results. This should not just highlight the limitations but also discuss the implications, such as the potential for overfitting, underperformance in unseen datasets, or the necessity for more diverse data annotation strategies.</li><br><li> <b>Enhanced Transparency:</b> While acknowledging limitations can seem counterintuitive, it actually strengthens the research by providing a complete view of the work done. It also benchmarks the current state for future work to build upon. Therefore, ensure that the limitations section is detailed, transparent, and constructive.</li><br><li> <b>Data and Model Limitations:</b> If the model's performance is influenced by data quality, diversity, or size, detail these aspects. Similarly, if the model architecture has known weaknesses in handling certain types of data or tasks, these should be explicitly stated.</li><br></ol>In providing these details clearly and concisely within the paper, you'll enhance its value to the community, providing a solid foundation for both understanding the current work and building future research upon it.<br></div>

While Sections 3.2 and 4.2 mention settings for models, ensure these descriptions include all necessary information for replication, such as hyperparameter values, data augmentation techniques, and training iterations.<br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Dataset Accessibility:</b></li></ol>- The paper mentions that the dataset and source code can be accessed at a GitHub link. Confirm that this link is both accessible and contains not just the dataset and code, but also a clear README file detailing how to use them to replicate the experiments.<br><ol><li> <b>Detail on Model Training and Evaluation:</b></li></ol>- Provide more specifics on the training process, including loss function details, optimization algorithms, batch sizes, and learning rates for each model evaluated. This can help in accurately reproducing the experiments.<br><ol><li> <b>Dependencies and Environment Specification:</b></li></ol>- Include a requirements.txt or an environment.yml file in the code repository to specify the exact versions of libraries and dependencies used. This is crucial for reproducibility, as future updates to libraries may introduce changes that affect the outcome of the experiments.<br><ol><li> <b>Address Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Settings:</b></li></ol>- If any special considerations or techniques were used for training or evaluating models in the OOD settings (Test-set-II), specify these details. OOD performance can significantly vary based on how the models are fine-tuned or adapted to new distributions.<br><ol><li> <b>Error Analysis and Supplement Material:</b></li></ol>- An in-depth error analysis can provide insights into why certain models performed the way they did, especially in comparing human and machine performance.

There are no significant discrepancies observed between the provided information and the actual paper content regarding open access to data and code, as well as sufficient instructions to reproduce the main experimental results. Below are specific recommendations to further improve the transparency and reproducibility of the work, in line with the NeurIPS guidelines:<br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Environment Details</b>: While the GitHub link and appendix information suggest openness, ensure detailed environment setup instructions are provided or linked within the GitHub repository. This includes specifying versions of the programming language (e.g., Python), libraries used (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), and any dependencies. This also helps in setting up the exact environment needed to reproduce the results faithfully.</li><br><li> <b>Include Exact Commands</b>: The documentation should ideally include the exact commands needed to run the experiments, from preprocessing the data to training the models and evaluating them. This step-by-step guide ensures that other researchers can replicate the study's findings without ambiguity.</li><br><li> <b>Data Accessibility and Licensing</b>: Confirm that the dataset used in the experiments, especially being a unique dataset for a low-resource language, is not only accessible but also clearly states the terms of use or licensing information. This clarification is important for ethical use and further research.</li><br><li> <b>Anonymity Preservation</b>: Given the NeurIPS submission rules, ensure that any links to datasets or code repositories are anonymized correctly and do not give away the authors' identities if the submission is intended to be double-blind. If this paper is past the review stage, ensure the correct acknowledgment of contributors or institutions associated with the dataset creation and code development.</li><br><li> <b>Supplementary Material Checks</b>: If there are any supplementary materials (beyond the dataset and code), such as additional experiment details, pseudocode, or expanded methodological explanations, ensure they are either included in the appendix or uploaded with the submission if the conference platform allows. These materials can aid in providing the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the conducted experiments.</li><br><li> <b>Detailing the Model Checkpoint Availability</b>: If possible, provide access to trained model checkpoints. This allows researchers to not only reproduce the results but also utilize the pre-trained models for further experiments or comparative studies without the need to retrain from scratch, saving computational resources.</li><br><li> <b>Expand on Data Collection and Processing Details</b>: Although the paper mentions the dataset and its source, expanding on any preprocessing steps, challenges faced during data collection, or ethical considerations ensures transparency. This is particularly relevant for datasets involving languages or scripts with potentially sensitive cultural significance.</li><br></ol>Addressing these recommendations can substantially enhance the reproducibility of the paper's contributions and adhere closely to the NeurIPS guidelines for open and accessible research.<br><br></div>

According to the guidelines provided for NeurIPS submissions, both potential positive and negative societal impacts should be discussed. However, the justification provided by the authors states that "All potential impact is positive," which directly contradicts the requirement to discuss both aspects. This oversight indicates a critical issue in addressing the guidelines for potential societal impacts.<br><b>Actionable Feedback</b>:<br><ol><li> <b>Address Both Positive and Negative Impacts</b>: Revise the societal impact section to include potential negative impacts of the work, as per the NeurIPS guidelines.

The authors have declared their answer as "NA" with the justification that there are no Large Language Models (LLMs) or Generative AI (GenAI) involved in their work. However, this response appears to overlook a crucial aspect of the question, which is about safeguards for responsibly releasing datasets, particularly those that could be considered at high risk for misuse. Given that the paper introduces a new OCR dataset for historical handwritten Ethiopic script, which involves releasing a dataset potentially scraped or derived from historical documents, the question of safeguards for responsible release is directly relevant.<br>Here's the itemized, actionable feedback based on the guidelines and the paper's content:<br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Dataset Licensing and Access</b>: It is crucial to specify the licensing under which the HHD-Ethiopic dataset is released. Clearly point out in the paper whether the dataset is openly accessible and under what terms, e.g., CC-BY, CC-BY-NC. This step ensures transparency and informs users about the potential usage of the dataset.</li><br><li> <b>Detail Ethical Considerations</b>: Given the dataset compiles historical documents, it's important to discuss any ethical considerations taken, such as respecting the cultural and historical significance of the documents, privacy concerns, and consent for digitization and publication (if applicable).</li><br><li> <b>Explain Safeguards Against Misuse</b>: The paper should include a section dedicated to potential risks and safeguards against the misuse of the dataset. This could cover measures like anonymization of sensitive information (if any exists in the dataset), restrictions on usage, or guidelines provided to users to prevent harmful applications.</li><br><li> <b>Evaluate Dual-Use Risks</b>: Although the dataset might primarily serve academic and research goals, assessing dual-use risks (where technology can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes) is essential. Discuss any foreseeable dual-use scenarios specific to the HHD-Ethiopic dataset and how such risks are mitigated.</li><br><li> <b>Include a Datasheet for Transparency</b>: Follow the practice of attaching a datasheet or data statement with the dataset, as proposed by Gebru et al. (2021), detailing the dataset collection process, intended use, limitations, and ethical considerations. This document should be summarized and referenced in the paper.</li><br></ol>Incorporating these elements into the paper will not only strengthen the authors' commitment to responsible data release but also enhance the paper's utility for future researchers and practitioners in the field.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> Based on the authors' proposed answer and justification, and considering the guidelines and content of the "HHD-Ethiopic A Historical Handwritten Dataset for Ethiopic OCR with Baseline Models and Human-level Performance" paper, the following feedback is provided to improve the quality of the paper:<br><ol><li> Explicitly Address Human Subject Research Concerns:</li></ol>- Though the paper’s focus on OCR technology suggests minimal direct risks from human subjects research, the involvement of multiple annotators in dataset labeling might warrant a brief discussion on ethical considerations and consent, particularly if personal or sensitive historical documents were involved in the dataset.<br><ol><li> Clarify the Selection and Role of Annotators:</li></ol>- The paper mentions the employment of annotators for labeling the dataset and assessing human-level recognition performance. Clarify the criteria used for selecting these annotators concerning their familiarity with the Ethiopic script and any measures taken to ensure their consistent performance and understanding of the task, which indirectly relates to ethical considerations of fairness and competency.<br><ol><li> Describe Measures to Protect Annotator’s Privacy and Consent:</li></ol>- While direct risks to annotators may be minimal, it's prudent to describe any measures taken to protect the privacy and consent of annotators, especially considering the potential sensitivity of their interaction with historical documents.<br><ol><li> Examination and Disclosure of Risks Related to Dataset Use:</li></ol>- Given that the dataset consists of historical documents, there is a potential risk of misinterpretation or misuse of the cultural content. The paper should briefly discuss any steps taken to mitigate such risks, like guidance on proper use or restrictions on dataset access.<br><ol><li> Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Equivalent Ethical Review:</li></ol>- If applicable, mention any review or approval from an IRB or an equivalent ethical committee, especially considering that the dataset compilation involved human effort in annotation. If such a review was not deemed necessary, provide a rationale, perhaps citing the absence of sensitive personal data or direct human subjects research beyond data annotation.<ol><li> Dataset Accessibility and Responsible Use:</li></ol>- Elaborate on access controls or guidelines established for using the HHD-Ethiopic dataset to ensure responsible utilization, respecting the cultural and historical significance of the documents included.<br><ol><li> Addressing Potential Socio-Cultural Impacts:</li></ol>- Discuss any considerations or measures taken to address the socio-cultural impacts of automating the reading of historical Ethiopian scripts, including both positive impacts (e.g., preservation and accessibility of cultural heritage) and any potential negative impacts (e.g., misinterpretation or cultural insensitivity).<br>By addressing these points, the paper will not only meet ethical and scholarly standards but also contribute responsibly to the field of OCR technology and the preservation of cultural heritage. This includes recognizing the role of human annotators in dataset creation, the sensitivity of historical documents, and the broader socio-cultural implications of technological applications.<br><br></div>
