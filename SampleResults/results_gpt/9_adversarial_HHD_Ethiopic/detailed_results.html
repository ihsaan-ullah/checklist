However, while the paper details the development of a multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MoBO) algorithm and its application to OCR models, the abstract mentions machine learning hyperparameter optimization in a general context without explicitly making the connection to its application in OCR, particularly for the Ethiopic script. Moreover, the transition from discussing generalized MOHPO challenges to introducing a historical handwritten dataset for the Ethiopic script is abrupt and lacks cohesion. The paper's title suggests a focus on the HHD-Ethiopic dataset for OCR, but the abstract and introduction cover broader MOHPO advancements without directly tying these to the OCR application until much later sections.<br>Feedback:<ol><li> Clarify the connection between MOHPO advancements and their application to OCR in both the abstract and introduction. Explicitly state how the proposed MoBO algorithm benefits the specific OCR tasks, especially for low-resource scripts like Ethiopic.</li><li> Provide a smoother transition from discussing general hyperparameter optimization challenges to introducing the HHD-Ethiopic dataset and its relevance. Connect these sections by highlighting the importance of the dataset in addressing the specific challenges of OCR for Ethiopic scripts.</li><li> The paper should explicitly mention the novel contributions relating to the HHD-Ethiopic dataset early in the introduction, including its significance for OCR research in underrepresented languages.</li><li> Ensure the abstract balances the description of both MOHPO algorithmic contributions and the introduction of the HHD-Ethiopic dataset. Both are major contributions, but their representation in the abstract and introduction appears disjointed.</li><li> Revise the title if necessary to more accurately reflect the dual focus on MOHPO and the Ethiopic OCR dataset, ensuring it captures the essence of both significant contributions.</li><br><br></ol></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' answer to the question about discussing the limitations of the work performed is generally in alignment with what is expected in NeurIPS conference submissions. However, the authors' justification for their answer points out specific instances mentioned in the paper without giving precise section references where these discussions can be found. This lack of specificity makes it challenging to verify the claims directly.<br><h3>Actionable Feedback</h3><br><ol><li> <b>Specific Section References</b>: The authors should modify the justification to include specific section numbers or titles where the limitations are discussed. For instance, instead of stating "We acknowledged in the annotation process," they could rephrase it to "In Section 3.1 (Dataset and Baseline Methods), we discuss limitations concerning the annotation process..."</li><br><li> <b>Broadening Limitations Discussion</b>: While the answer points to computational resources and annotator challenges, the paper could benefit from a more extensive discussion on limitations. This includes reflecting on the machine learning model's performance across different test settings, robustness to dataset biases, and generalizability to unseen data, potentially in a designated "Limitations" section as recommended.</li><br><li> <b>Clarity on Future Work</b>: While mentioning future work in the conclusion is good, distinguishing clearly between limitations of the current work and areas for future exploration could enhance the paper's quality. Different subsections for "Limitations" and "Future Work" within the conclusion section could be beneficial.</li><br><li> <b>Assumptions and Their Impact</b>: The paper should articulate any assumptions made during the development of the machine learning models and discuss how violations of these assumptions might affect the results. This is especially important given the dataset's unique characteristics and the potential variance in OCR performance across scripts.</li><br><li> <b>Include Discussion on Data Privacy and Fairness</b>: If the dataset includes or potentially impacts individual privacy or introduces bias, these aspects need to be addressed directly in the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Enhance Discussion on Computational Efficiency</b>: If computational limitations were a significant challenge, the paper could benefit from a more nuanced discussion on how these limitations impacted the approach or results and potential pathways to mitigate these limitations in future work.</li><br><li> <b>Transparency and Reproducibility</b>: Ensuring that the discussion on limitations aids in the transparency and reproducibility of the research. If certain experiments could not be performed due to the stated limitations, explicitly stating so helps set the right expectations.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors can significantly improve the paper's quality, contributing to a more transparent and constructive scientific dialogue within the community.<br><ol><li>5</li></ol></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The author's proposed answer is inconsistent with the content of the paper, which does include theoretical results. Specifically, the paper contains a theorem (Theorem 1) and a corollary (Corollary 1) in Section 4, contradicting the author's claim that their paper does not include any theory. This discrepancy means the appropriate action for the checklist question on theoretical results should be "Yes," and the justification should point to Section 4 where the theorem and its corollary are presented.<br>To align the paper with the guidelines on reporting theoretical results, the following improvements are recommended:<br><ol><li> <b>Update Checklist Response</b>: Change the answer to the checklist question on theoretical results to "Yes," indicating that the paper does contain theoretical contributions.</li><br><li> <b>Provide Full Set of Assumptions</b>: Ensure that all assumptions made for Theorem 1 and its corollary are explicitly stated or referenced in the paper. If these assumptions are spread out in different sections, consider summarizing them in Section 4 for clarity.</li><br><li> <b>Complete and Correct Proof</b>: Confirm that the proof of Theorem 1 and the justification of Corollary 1 are both complete and correct. If the proofs are too lengthy for the main body, include them in an appendix or supplemental material, referencing this clearly in Section 4.</li><br><li> <b>Cross-Reference Theorem and Related Work</b>: The authors should cross-reference Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 within the paper, especially when discussing methodological contributions, results, or comparing with related works. This will highlight the theoretical foundations of their research contributions more thoroughly.</li><br><li> <b>Proof Sketch in Main Body</b>: If the complete proof is moved to an appendix or supplementary material for brevity, consider providing a short proof sketch in Section 4. This would offer readers a clearer understanding of the theoremâ€™s implications and its significance to the paper's contributions.</li><br><li> <b>Reference Theorems and Lemmas</b>: Properly reference any external theorems, lemmas, or foundational works that Theorem 1 and Corollary 1 rely upon. This step is crucial for situating the paper within the broader research landscape and ensuring the originality and contribution of the theoretical aspects.</li><br></ol>Incorporating these improvements will ensure compliance with the checklist guidelines, enhance the clarity and integrity of the theoretical contributions, and potentially increase the paperâ€™s impact and acceptance likelihood at the NeurIPS conference.<br></div>

Actionable feedback: Authors should list hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, epochs) and any model-specific settings to ensure clarity.</li><br><li> <b>Evaluation Metrics and Statistical Measures</b>: For replicating and validating experimental results, it's critical to understand how results were evaluated and the statistical methods used to ensure findings' validity. While human-level performance and baseline comparisons are discussed, explicit mention of evaluation metrics (e.g., Character Error Rate, Word Error Rate) and any statistical tests or confidence intervals used would enhance reproducibility. Actionable feedback: Specify all evaluation metrics used and provide justification for their choice, along with any statistical methods applied to analyze the experiment results.</li><br><li> <b>Software and Hardware Environment</b>: Reproducing experimental results may also depend on the computational environment, including software versions (e.g., machine learning libraries, languages) and hardware specifications. Actionable feedback: Include a section on the software (with versions) and hardware used to conduct experiments to aid in replicating the setup.</li><br><li> <b>Accessibility of Training, Validation, and Test Sets</b>: The paper mentions the availability of the dataset and codebase, which is commendable. However, ensuring that splits of data (training, validation, test sets) are clearly defined and accessible is crucial for reproductions. Actionable feedback: Ensure the dataset splits used in experiments are publicly accessible or clearly documented in the repository linked, including any specific instructions for generating dataset splits if applicable.</li><br><li> <b>License and Use Permissions</b>: For datasets and code, clarity on licensing and use permissions facilitates reproducibility and future research. Actionable feedback: Specify the license under which the dataset and code are released and any restrictions on their use.</li><br></ol><b>Concluding with a score considering the guidance provided and the checklist for ensuring experimental reproducibility, it appears there may be room for improvement in detailing and explicitly documenting experimental procedures, configurations, and environments.</b><br><br></div>

This includes providing a clear, anonymized URL if the assets are hosted online, ensuring that the link is functional and that any required access permissions are clearly stated.</li><br></ol>To make these improvements actionable, the authors should revise their paper and supplementary materials to address these points specifically. It is also advised to include examples of use-cases or previous research utilizing the dataset (if any) to illustrate its value and applications further. Such revisions would enhance the paper's contribution to the community by providing a well-documented resource for advancing OCR technologies, especially for underrepresented scripts.<br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The author's proposed answer to the checklist question is "NA" with the justification that there were no crowdsourcing experiments conducted. Given the content of the paper titled "HHD-Ethiopic A Historical Handwritten Dataset for Ethiopic OCR with Baseline Models and Human-level Performance," the focus is primarily on the development and evaluation of a machine learning framework and dataset for recognizing Ethiopic script in handwritten documents. The paper outlines the dataset's creation, characteristics, and the methods for building and assessing OCR models, including comparisons with human-level performance. No mention or indication of crowdsourcing experiments or research involving human subjects, in the sense of data collection from a crowd via platforms like Mechanical Turk or similar, is noted in the summary provided. However, the paper does discuss human involvement in the dataset creation and evaluation process.<br>Given the details provided and adhering strictly to the guidelines and the context of the checklist question, the authors' response appears aligned with the paper content regarding the specific aspect of crowdsourcing. However, there is a significant involvement of human participants in creating and evaluating the dataset, which broadly falls under research with human subjects. This raises a nuanced interpretation of the checklist question, possibly requiring clarification or expansion regarding what constitutes "research with human subjects" beyond conventional crowdsourcing models.<br><b>Actionable Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Involvement of Human Participants:</b> Although not technically crowdsourcing, the paper involves human subjects in data annotation and evaluation. The authors should consider providing more detailed information about the recruitment, consent process (if any), and compensation for these participants, to align with ethical research practices, even if the primary activity is not labeled as crowdsourcing.</li><br><li> <b>Expand on Ethical Considerations:</b> Given the involvement of high school students in data annotation, a discussion on ethical considerations, including parental consent, participant privacy, and data protection measures, would enhance the paper's adherence to ethical standards in research involving human subjects.</li><br><li> <b>Detail Compensation Structure:</b> If the participatory individuals (e.g., annotators and reviewers) received any form of compensation, acknowledgment, or incentives, detailing this would provide transparency and adhere to guidelines about compensation disclosure in research involving human labor.</li><br><li> <b>Include Participant Demographic Breakdown:</b> Offering a demographic breakdown and mentioning any diversity considerations or limitations in the participant pool could add value to the dataset's representation and utility discussion.</li><br><li> <b>Provide Access to Consent Forms or Guidelines:</b> If applicable, making the consent forms or participant instruction guidelines available as part of the supplementary materials could offer insights into the ethical framing and participant briefing process of the study.</li><br></ol></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The "NA" answer and the justification provided by the authors indicate a misunderstanding or oversight concerning the involvement of human participants in the creation of the HHD-Ethiopic dataset. The paper detailed extensive involvement of human annotators in the dataset creation and validation process. It mentions the recruitment of participants for dataset annotation, the use of human-level performance as a baseline for model evaluation, and the collection of ground truth data involving human judgment. These activities clearly involve human subjects in the research, and thus, ethical considerations including IRB approval, disclosure of risks to participants, and informed consent processes are relevant and necessary to discuss in the paper.<br><b>Actionable Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Revise the Answer to Reflect Human Subject Research</b>: Acknowledge the involvement of human participants in the dataset creation and validation sections. The answer to the checklist question should be revised from "NA" to "Yes," indicating the involvement of human subjects in the research.</li><br><li> <b>Disclose Participant Involvement and Ethical Considerations</b>: Detail the process of participant recruitment, the nature of their involvement, any risks or burdens posed by the participation, and how these were communicated to the participants. If any benefits were offered (e.g., educational), this should also be disclosed.</li><br><li> <b>IRB Approval and Informed Consent Process</b>: If the study was reviewed by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or an equivalent ethics committee, the paper should state this, including any IRB approval numbers or statements of exemption, while maintaining anonymity for blind review purposes. If specific IRB approval was not obtained, provide a justification based on the ethical guidelines followed (e.g., exemption due to minimal risk). Also, describe the informed consent process, ensuring that participants were aware of the research purpose, their rights, and could consent or withdraw without penalties.</li><br><li> <b>Clarification on Data Privacy and Anonymization</b>: Given the sensitive nature of historical documents and the involvement of human annotators, clarify how data privacy was ensured, especially in terms of anonymizing participants' data and protecting any potentially sensitive information contained in the dataset.</li><br><li> <b>Impact on Participants and Mitigation Strategies</b>: Discuss any potential negative impacts on the human annotators or individuals depicted or mentioned in the historical documents and outline measures taken to mitigate these risks.</li><br><li> <b>Ensuring the Paper Aligns with NeurIPS Ethical Guidelines</b>: Revisit the NeurIPS guidelines on ethics and ensure the paper's content complies with these, especially concerning transparency, accountability, and respect for all participants involved in the research.</li><br></ol>Inclusion of the above details will not only enhance the paper's compliance with ethical standards but also enrich the readers' understanding of the methodological rigor and ethical considerations underlying the creation and validation of the HHD-Ethiopic dataset.<br></div>
