However, the justification lacks specific references to sections that contain the related material, which does not fully adhere to the guidelines provided for the question. As per the guidelines, the authors should specify the sections where the claims made in the abstract and introduction are elaborated or evidenced.<br>Feedback to improve the paper quality:<br><ol><li> <b>Specify Sections in Justification</b>: The authors should amend their justification to include specific references to the sections of the paper where the main claims and contributions are discussed in detail. For example, the novelty of the approach could be further elaborated in Section 3, and the results of the comparison with baseline methods could be pointed out to Section 5.</li><br><li> <b>Clarification of Scope and Contributions</b>: Ensure that the abstract and introduction unequivocally delineate the paper's scope and its main contributions. The abstract does a good job of presenting the approach and benchmarks, but could benefit from a succinct statement about how the findings advance the field of Active Meta Learning and Recommender Systems for algorithm selection.</li><br><li> <b>Highlight Uniqueness in Introduction</b>: The introduction should clearly highlight what sets this work apart from existing approaches in a more pronounced manner. It may be useful to explicitly list the paper's contributions (e.g., "This work is the first to...", "Our contributions include...") early in the introduction to immediately clarify the paper's novelty and scope.</li><br><li> <b>Limitations and Assumptions</b>: Following the guidelines suggesting that the claims should reflect limitations and assumptions, ensure that any critical assumptions (e.g., the computational cost considerations discussed in Section 6) or potential limitations of the approach (such as the focus on 'classical' machine learning settings mentioned in the introduction) are clearly stated near the beginning of the paper. This will set realistic expectations for the reader and reflect a balanced view of the paper's scope.</li><br><li> <b>Aspirational Goals vs. Achievements</b>: If there are any 'aspirational goals' mentioned in the abstract or introduction that were not fully realized in the study, these should be clearly identified as such, ensuring that the readers are not misled about the paper's actual contributions.</li><br></ol>These enhancements will make the paper more transparent about its contributions, how it advances the field, and where the work fits within the existing body of knowledge. By addressing these items, the authors will strengthen their paper considerably, making it more valuable to readers and reviewers by clearly articulating its significance and positioning it accurately within the current research landscape.<br><br></div>

However, the discussion could be enhanced by explicitly addressing several pertinent issues outlined in the guidelines for improved transparency and completeness. Here are itemized, actionable feedback points based on the provided guidelines:<br><ol><li> <b>Explicit Discussion of Assumptions and Robustness:</b></li></ol>- Explicitly state any strong assumptions made during the study, such as the nature of the datasets (homogeneity, size, type) and algorithms (scalability, complexity). Discuss how the results might vary if these assumptions do not hold.- Reflect on the robustness of the proposed Active Meta Learning w. CofiRank method against violations of these assumptions, and specify any limitations this might impose on the generalizability of the findings.<br><ol><li> <b>Scope of Claims:</b></li></ol>- Clarify the scope of the claims made in the paper. If the approach was primarily tested on a limited number of datasets or with a limited range of algorithms, explicitly state this limitation.- Discuss the implications of these limitations for the applicability of the method to a broader range of datasets or problems.<br><ol><li> <b>Influence of Performance Factors:</b></li></ol>- Offer a deeper analysis of factors that could affect the performance of the proposed method. For example, discuss how dataset characteristics (e.g., size, feature type) or algorithm properties (e.g., complexity) may influence the efficacy of algorithm recommendations.- Include any observed or anticipated performance issues related to these factors and suggest potential remedies or areas for further investigation.<br><ol><li> <b>Computational Efficiency and Scalability:</b></li></ol>- Provide a more detailed discussion on the computational efficiency of the approach, especially in the context of large datasets. Discuss any limitations observed in terms of scalability and potential strategies to overcome them.<ol><li> <b>Considerations on Privacy and Fairness (if applicable):</b></li></ol>- If relevant, discuss any potential limitations of the proposed method regarding privacy and fairness. Reflect on how the approach might be adapted to address these concerns or why these issues might not be applicable to the current work.<br><ol><li> <b>Acknowledgement of Unaddressed Limitations:</b></li></ol>- Acknowledge any limitations that were not explicitly addressed in the paper and suggest how future work could address these gaps. This may include limitations related to the methodology, datasets used, or interpretation of results.<br><ol><li> <b>References to Supplemental Material:</b></li></ol>- If additional insights into limitations are provided in the supplemental material, actively encourage readers to consult this material for a more comprehensive understanding of the work’s constraints.<br>By addressing these feedback points, the authors can significantly enhance the transparency and integrity of their work, potentially increasing its impact and usability for future research in the field.<br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The proposed authors' answer to the checklist question regarding the provision of full sets of assumptions and complete, correct proofs for each theoretical result is marked as "NA" with the justification that the paper does not include theoretical results. However, upon reviewing the content of the paper titled "ACTIVMETAL: Algorithm Recommendation with Active Meta Learning," it appears this assessment needs re-evaluation.<br><ol><li> <b>Clarification of Theoretical Contributions</b>: Although the main body of the paper focuses on an empirical approach to algorithm recommendation through active meta-learning, the methodology section (Section 3) and the algorithms introduced (Algorithms 1-5) have substantial theoretical underpinnings. It is essential to clarify if any theoretical results, such as guarantees on performance, convergence properties, or optimality conditions, are implicitly assumed or relied upon in these methods.</li><br><li> <b>Explicit Statements of Assumptions</b>: For the methodologies and algorithms presented, it is crucial to provide an explicit statement of assumptions. This includes assumptions about the datasets (e.g., properties of the performance matrix), algorithms (e.g., the behavior of the CofiRank algorithm under certain conditions), and the active meta-learning framework.</li><br><li> <b>Provision of Proofs or Theoretical Analyses</b>: If there are implicit theoretical claims associated with the proposed methodology, such as efficiency, scalability, or performance guarantees, it is imperative to provide or reference complete proofs or theoretical analyses, even if they exist in the supplementary materials. This could include proofs of convergence, optimality, or any formal properties that the active meta-learning approach satisfies.</li><br><li> <b>Numbering and Reference of Theorems</b>: If upon re-assessment, the paper is found to include theoretical results or relies on theoretical properties, each should be systematically numbered and referenced. This includes not just the main text but also any supplementary materials where detailed proofs might be located.</li><br><li> <b>References to Supplementary Material</b>: Should detailed proofs or extended theoretical analyses be included in the supplementary materials, the paper must explicitly reference these sections when discussing related results. A brief proof sketch in the main text to provide intuition, complemented by detailed proofs in appendix or supplementary material, could enhance the paper's clarity and credibility.</li><br><li> <b>Exploration of Computational Considerations</b>: Any informal discussions or claims regarding computational efficiency, as mentioned when discussing the superiority of the method in terms of computational cost, should be backed by either theoretical justification or empirical evidence, with clear assumptions stated.</li><br></ol>Actionable Feedback:<ul><li>Revisit the methodology section and algorithms to identify any implicit theoretical contributions or claims.</li><li>Clearly state all assumptions associated with the methodologies and algorithms.</li><li>Include or reference complete proofs or theoretical analyses for any implicit theoretical claims, preferably in the supplementary materials.</li><li>Number and reference any theorems or formal claims made, ensuring they are easily locatable within the paper or supplementary material.</li><li>Explicitly reference sections in the supplementary material where detailed proofs or additional theoretical analyses are provided.</li><br><br></ul></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors have provided a "Yes" answer to the question of whether all training and test details necessary to understand the results have been specified in the paper, pointing to the "Results" section for these details. Upon review of the paper's content and structure, there are several discrepancies and areas for improvement between the provided justification and the Guidelines for NeurIPS conference submissions regarding the specificity and location of methodological details:<br><ol><li> <b>Location of Methodological Details:</b> It is customary to provide details about the training and test setup, hyperparameters, data splits, and optimizer types in the methodology or experimental setup sections rather than the results section. The results section typically discusses outcomes rather than experimental configurations. Actionable feedback includes clearly describing the experimental setup in a dedicated section before the results.</li><br><li> <b>Detail on Hyperparameters and their Selection:</b> It's not evident from the provided text that the paper specifies how hyperparameters were chosen. For rigor and reproducibility, it is crucial to explain if they were selected based on previous literature, empirical tests, or optimization techniques (such as grid search or Bayesian optimization). Suggested improvement entails adding a subsection detailing the hyperparameters' selection process and justification.</li><br><li> <b>Explanation of Data Splits:</b> While the paper mentions the use of cross-validation in passing, it does not specifically outline how data were split between training and testing phases or if these were standardized or stratified splits. The authors should provide explicit details on the data splitting methodology employed, including ratios or cross-validation folds.</li><br><li> <b>Optimization Algorithm and Configurations:</b> There's a lack of information on what type of optimizer was employed and its configuration. Details such as the learning rate, batch size (if applicable), and specific optimization algorithms (e.g., SGD, Adam) could significantly impact the reproducibility and understanding of the results. The paper should include a part that discusses the optimization strategy and configurations used.</li><br><li> <b>Rationale Behind Choices:</b> For the decisions made regarding the experimental setup (e.g., the specific division of datasets, chosen hyperparameters, the optimizer), a rationale should be provided. This information is crucial for understanding the experiments' design and ensuring they can be replicated and validated by others in the community.</li><br><li> <b>Consistency with NeurIPS Guidelines:</b> Ensure that the revisions made to include the above details adhere to the NeurIPS formatting and submission guidelines. This ensures that the paper meets all requirements for a successful conference submission.</li><br></ol>Improvements in these areas can significantly enhance the comprehensibility, replicability, and overall quality of the paper.

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors claim that error bars and statistical significance details are suitably reported in the "Results" section and the associated figures. Based on the guidelines provided for NeurIPS submissions, a few critical observations and recommendations to improve the quality of the paper are provided below:<br><ol><li> <b>Clarity on Statistical Methods</b>: While the authors mention that error bars are included, there is no specific mention in the provided text about how these error bars were calculated. For instance, whether they represent standard deviations, standard errors, confidence intervals, or if bootstrap methods were employed. Actionable suggestion: The authors should explicitly state the statistical methods used to estimate error bars, including any assumptions (e.g., normality of errors). This clarification is crucial for reproducibility and understanding the reliability of the results.</li><br><li> <b>Explanation of Error Bar Significance</b>: The guidelines indicate that the significance of the error bars (like capturing variability due to train/test split, initialization) should be clearly mentioned. The provided text lacks any such explanation. Actionable suggestion: Add a precise description of what factors of variability the error bars are capturing directly in the text or within the figure captions to provide a clearer context of the results' stability and reliability.</li><br><li> <b>Confidence Interval Information</b>: While the authors claim to report statistical significance correctly, the details on whether a 1-sigma or 2-sigma error bar is reported, or if the results include a 95% confidence interval, are missing. Actionable suggestion: The authors should explicitly state the confidence level of the error bars presented and ensure it aligns with the standard practices (e.g., 95% CI is commonly expected) or the community's expectations for such analyses.</li><br><li> <b>Addressing Asymmetric Distributions</b>: The text does not mention how asymmetric distributions were handled for error bars, which is critical as symmetric error bars might not accurately represent the underlying data distribution. Actionable suggestion: If relevant, describe the approach for handling asymmetric distributions to ensure the accuracy of reported error bars or statistical significance details.</li><br><li> <b>Reference to Error Bars Calculation in Text</b>: Although there is a general reference to the "Results" section and figures for error bars, direct references (e.g., specific figure numbers, table numbers) are missing, making it harder for readers to locate this crucial information. Actionable suggestion: Provide direct references to where in the text or which figures/tables display the error bars and statistical significance information to guide readers more effectively.</li><br></ol>By addressing these highlighted areas, the authors can significantly enhance the transparency and reliability of the statistical reporting in the paper. This will not only improve the paper's quality but also its usefulness to the readers and the broader community by setting a robust example of statistical reporting.<br><br></div>

The guidelines for authors indicate that for a "Yes" response, the paper should point to specific sections where related materials can be found. While the authors opted for "No," common expectations based on the guidelines would necessitate a clearer justification explaining why details on computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) are omitted or deemed inapplicable. Given the experimental nature of the work as described in the paper, detailed descriptions of compute resources are essential for ensuring reproducibility and transparency of the experimental results.<br><b>Feedback</b>:<br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Computational Resource Description</b>: If details on the computation resources are indeed present within the paper but not explicitly linked in the justification, it would be beneficial for the authors to specify where in the paper these details are provided. If such details are genuinely absent, the authors should consider adding a section or supplement that outlines the computational resources utilized for their experiments, including the type of processors (CPU/GPU), memory specifications, estimated execution times, and whether computations were performed on an internal cluster or cloud platforms. This inclusion will ensure clarity and enable reproducibility.</li></ol><ol><li> <b>Expand Justification for Omission</b>: Should there be specific reasons for omitting detailed computational resource information (e.g., standardized environments across experiments or prohibitive computational diversity), these rationales should be thoroughly explained. Including such reasoning will adhere to the guideline’s provision for acceptable "No" responses, offering readers a clear understanding of omissions.</li><br><li> <b>Consideration for Computational Cost</b>: Where detailed computational resource information is not viable or available, the authors might offer general guidelines on the computational cost (e.g., light, moderate, heavy) associated with reproducing their experiments. This approach can provide readers with an approximate understanding of the computational demand without specific hardware and execution time data.</li><br><li> <b>Address Preliminary or Failed Experiments</b>: The guidelines suggest disclosing if the full research project required more compute than reported for the experiments. A brief discussion on this aspect, if relevant, could provide a fuller picture of the computational demands entailed in the study, encompassing preliminary or auxiliary analyses not detailed within the main experimental results.</li><br></ol><b>Conclusion</b>:The absence of explicit mention or justification for omitting details on computational resources represents a missed opportunity for transparency and reproducibility. Addressing this feedback will significantly enrich the manuscript's alignment with best practices for scientific reporting in the machine learning domain.<br></div>

This includes understanding how their algorithm recommendations could be deployed in real-world scenarios and any possible negative outcomes.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Dataset Sources and Permissions</b>: The paper should provide detailed information about the datasets used, including their sources, any permissions required for their use, and the measures taken to ensure the privacy and security of data subjects. If scraped datasets are utilized, it is crucial to discuss the ethical considerations involved in their collection and use.</li><br><li> <b>Discuss Safeguard Implementation</b>: Should any potential risks be identified upon reassessment, the authors need to discuss the safeguards they have put in place or recommend best practices for responsibly using their model. This includes any limitations on data or model access and specific guidelines users must follow to prevent misuse.</li><br><li> <b>Transparent Reporting of Model Limitations</b>: The paper should include a section that transparently discusses the limitations of the proposed method, including scenarios where it might not perform as expected and any biases that could influence its recommendations. This transparency can help mitigate risks by informing users about the appropriate contexts for the tool's application.</li><br><li> <b>Inclusion of an Ethics Statement</b>: Given the use of real-world datasets and the emphasis on responsible AI research, the authors should consider adding an ethics statement that outlines the ethical considerations taken into account during their research, including any potential societal impacts.</li><br><li> <b>Consideration of Dual Use</b>: While the paper focuses on algorithm recommendation for model selection, discussing the concept of dual use—where technology developed for beneficial purposes could also be used maliciously—is essential.

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The provided answer and justification correctly state that the paper is not involved with crowdsourcing experiments or research with human subjects. Thus, the requirement to include full texts of instructions given to participants alongside screenshots and details about compensation, if any, does not apply to this paper. After reviewing the content of the paper, it is clear that the focus is on algorithm recommendation using active meta-learning, which involves computational models and datasets without direct human subject interaction or crowdsourcing.<br>However, to ensure the answer aligns with NeurIPS guidelines and to provide thorough and transparent documentation, the following feedback is offered:<br><ol><li> Add a brief explicit statement in the relevant sections (e.g., Introduction or Methods) clarifying the paper's scope concerning human subjects and crowdsourcing. This will preemptively address any potential queries from readers or reviewers about the applicability of such considerations to your work.</li><br><li> Since the paper involves datasets from external sources (e.g., StatLog, OpenML, and AutoML), briefly discuss any ethical considerations or permissions related to the use of these datasets. Even though the question on human subjects and crowdsourcing is marked as NA, acknowledging dataset sourcing and usage ethics complements the paper's adherence to broader research integrity principles.</li><br><li> Include a section or paragraph on ethical considerations in the supplemental material or the main paper. This section can succinctly address the paper's computing-related ethical considerations, such as data privacy (even if not directly applicable), intellectual property rights regarding the algorithms studied, and the transparency in benchmarking practices.</li><br></ol>In conclusion, the paper's content is consistent with the authors' proposed answer to the checklist question, indicating that no direct action is required on this specific point. However, the recommended enhancements focus on clarifying the non-applicability of this criterion and bolstering the paper's ethical transparency. These steps will ensure the paper meets NeurIPS guidelines comprehensively and addresses any potential ethical considerations related to its computational research scope.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer (NA) and justification suggest that the paper does not involve research with human participants or crowdsourcing activities and thus does not require mentioning IRB approvals or participant risk disclosures. Upon review of the content provided from the "ACTIVMETAL" paper, it is clear that the research focuses solely on algorithm recommendation through active meta-learning, employing computational experiments based on previously collected datasets (StatLog, OpenML, AutoML, and artificial data) for benchmarking. These activities inherently do not involve human subjects in the sense typically requiring ethical review (such as interventions, surveys, or studies involving personal data beyond publicly available datasets).<br>Given the information provided:<br><ol><li> <b>Confirm the Paper's Focus is Non-human-subject Research</b>: It is crucial to ensure the paper strictly discusses computational techniques, algorithms, model performance, and data from existing datasets without collecting or analyzing personal or sensitive information from individuals. The paper maintains this focus as described.</li><br><li> <b>Review Data Source and Usage Compliance</b>: Although direct human subjects' risks are not applicable, the paper should clarify if the datasets used have any restrictions or require any ethical considerations. For example, datasets sourced from OpenML are often aggregations of publicly shared data, but the ultimate use might be subject to terms specific to individual datasets.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Computational Experiment Nature</b>: It is helpful to explicitly state that the research constitutes computational experiments utilizing existing datasets to simulate model selection processes, further distancing the study from direct human subjects' research.</li><br><li> <b>International and Institutional Policy Awareness</b>: It is good practice, even for studies not involving human subjects, to note awareness of and compliance with relevant ethical guidelines for research -- a statement indicating that the study's design is in compliance with such standards could enhance the paper's ethical clarity.</li><br><li> <b>Anonymity and Data Privacy Comments</b>: While not directly related to IRB or similar approvals, if any part of the dataset processing could potentially re-identify individuals or infringe on privacy even indirectly, this should be noted and justified appropriately.</li><br></ol>Given that the paper concerns algorithmic development and performance assessments without directly interacting with human subjects or using data not already in the public domain, the authors' response aligns with the nature of their study. However, incorporating the suggested clarifications and considerations could strengthen the paper's ethical positioning and transparency.<br></div>
