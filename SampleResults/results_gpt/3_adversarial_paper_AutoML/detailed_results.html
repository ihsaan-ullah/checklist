However, the justification provided for this answer is inadequate as per the guidelines because it does not specify the sections where the related material can be found. The guidelines clearly state that if "Yes" is answered, the justification must point to the section(s) within which related material for the question can be found.<br><b>Feedback for Improvement:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Specify Section References:</b> Amend the justification by including specific references to sections or subsections in the paper where the main claims, contributions, and scope are clearly articulated. This will help readers and reviewers easily locate and verify the claims made in the abstract and introduction against the findings and discussions presented in the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Contributions in Abstract:</b> Ensure that the abstract concisely summarizes the main findings from the post-hoc analysis of the AutoML challenge, clearly delineating the contributions of the paper. If there are any aspirational goals mentioned, clarify which goals are achieved and which remain future work.</li><br><li> <b>Detail Contributions in Introduction:</b> In the introduction section, specifically highlight the novel contributions of the paper towards advancing AutoML research or understanding. If the paper claims improvements or insights over existing methods or challenges, explicitly state these claims and later support them with evidence in the body of the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Address Assumptions and Limitations:</b> If there are any assumptions made or limitations in the analysis, ensure these are briefly mentioned in the introduction and detailed in the relevant sections of the paper. This adds to the transparency and robustness of the paper's contributions.</li><br><li> <b>Consistency Between Sections:</b> Verify that the claims made in the abstract and introduction are consistent with the discussions and conclusions of the paper. Adjust any discrepancies where the contributions stated at the beginning do not align with the results and discussions provided in later sections.</li><br></ol>Improving these aspects will enhance the clarity, accuracy, and reliability of the paper, ensuring that the contributions and scope are properly communicated to the readers and reviewers.<br></div>

While this section might touch upon challenges encountered in establishing benchmarks and designing the challenge, it does not explicitly address the core limitations of the research methodology, the assumptions made, the specific datasets' choice, computational efficiency, or how these might affect the generalizability of the findings.<br><ol><li> <b>Broadening the Scope of Limitations:</b></li></ol>Based on the guidelines, the section on limitations should ideally cover a range of potential weaknesses, including strong assumptions, the robustness of the results upon violation of these assumptions, scope of claims (e.g., limited dataset diversity), and factors influencing performance. The provided justification suggests that the discussion may be more focused on the benchmark's design challenges rather than the methodological limitations inherent to the research approach or analytical methods applied.<br><ol><li> <b>Addressing Computational Limitations:</b></li></ol>The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms, especially in relation to high-dimensional data or large datasets, is a critical aspect that warrants a more detailed discussion. Furthermore, how these algorithms scale with dataset size or complexity could indicate their practical applicability in real-world scenarios.<br><ol><li> <b>Privacy and Fairness Considerations:</b></li></ol>Given the current emphasis on privacy and fairness in ML, especially in automated machine learning (AutoML), it's essential to evaluate whether these aspects are applicable and discussed adequately.

The authors might fear repercussions in terms of paper acceptance; however, acknowledging and rigorously discussing limitations can often bolster the paper's credibility and contribute to the field's advancement.<br><b>Actionable Recommendations:</b><br><ul><li>Expand the limitations discussion beyond the challenge and benchmark design to include methodological limitations, assumptions, and scope of generalizability.</li><li>Explicitly discuss computational limitations and scalability of the proposed algorithms.</li><li>If applicable, include a discussion on privacy and fairness considerations, especially if the AutoML approaches have potential applications in sensitive areas.</li><li>Consider reorganizing the section or integrating limitations within relevant sections throughout the paper to highlight critical reflections alongside the respective findings.</li><li>Encourage a culture of openness by framing limitations as pathways for future research or as context-specific considerations rather than unambiguous weaknesses.</li><br></ul></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors of "Lessons learned from the AutoML challenge" selected "NA" to answer if their paper provides a full set of assumptions and complete proofs for each theoretical result. This suggests that the paper does not contain theoretical results that would require providing assumptions and proofs. However, in the conclusion section of the paper, there is a mathematical induction proof provided for the sum of the first \(n\) natural numbers. This inconsistency between the content of the paper and the authors' response to the checklist question raises a discrepancy.<br><h3>Actionable Feedback:</h3><ol><li> <b>Clarify Theoretical Content</b>: The authors should reassess the content of their paper to accurately determine if it contains theoretical results. If the proof in the conclusion is considered part of the theoretical contributions, the paper does not correctly answer "NA" to the checklist question.</li></ol><ol><li> <b>Amend Response or Content</b>: If the authors consider the mathematical induction proof as part of the paper's theoretical contributions, they should change their response from "NA" to "Yes" and provide a justification referencing the section with the proof. Alternatively, if the intention is for the paper to not focus on theoretical results, it may be beneficial to either remove the proof or clarify its role in supporting the empirical findings or discussions presented.</li><br><li> <b>Ensure Consistency</b>: The paper needs to maintain consistency in how it presents and references its content in response to the checklist. If including theoretical proofs, these should be clearly marked, and any checklist responses should accurately reflect the paper's content.</li><br><li> <b>Provide Proof Details or Location</b>: If reclassifying the response to "Yes", ensure that full details of proofs or the location of these proofs (main paper or supplementary material) are provided according to the guidelines. This includes explicitly stating all assumptions and referencing or including complete proofs.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Role of Theoretical Results</b>: Consider adding a discussion in the paper about how the theoretical proof (the sum of the first n natural numbers) ties into the broader themes or findings of the AutoML challenge analysis. This could contextualize the proof and clarify its relevance to the readers.</li><br></ol>These steps will improve the clarity of the paper's contributions, ensuring that the checklist accurately reflects the content and aiding readers in understanding the nature of theoretical versus empirical results within the work.<br><br></div>

However, the thorough examination of the paper reveals a few critical areas lacking in detail and clarity, leading to potential reproducibility issues. Here are the elements that require improvement:<br><ol><li> <b>Detailed Experiment Setup</b>: While the paper mentions the resources used (e.g., GPU-accelerated nodes, high-memory CPU nodes), it does not specify configurations, software versions, and environments precisely. For exact replication, these details are crucial. Authors need to include information on the computational environment, including specific versions of software and libraries used.</li><br><li> <b>Parameter Settings and Models</b>: Although the paper states that models with a limited number of hyper-parameters have emerged, and mentions using AUTOSKLEARN, it lacks explicit configuration details of these models for the experiments conducted. To improve reproducibility, authors should list the hyper-parameter settings and configurations for each model evaluated in the study.</li><br><li> <b>Data Preprocessing Steps</b>: The preprocessing steps for handling the datasets are mentioned in broad strokes but lack specific implementation details. For complete clarity, the paper should describe each step taken to prepare the data for training and evaluation, including any data augmentation, cleaning, or transformation techniques applied.</li><br><li> <b>Statistical Analysis Methods</b>: The paper briefly mentions using K-fold cross-validation without giving details on how many folds were used or how the validation was structured across the different datasets. The reproducibility can be enhanced by providing exact details of the cross-validation technique and any other statistical methods used to ensure the validity of the experimental results.</li><br><li> <b>Code Accessibility</b>: Mentioning the URL in the abstract for accessing datasets, code, and challenge results is a positive step. However, ensuring the link leads to a well-organized repository with clearly documented code, including any necessary scripts to run the experiments, would further aid reproducibility. The authors should verify the presence of a README file with instructions on how to replicate the experiments and generate the reported results.</li><br><li> <b>Results Documentation</b>: The document should include comprehensive results in a way that readers can compare what they achieve by following the replication steps against what is presented in the paper. Detailed tables, charts, and potentially the raw output data should be accessible either within the paper or via the provided URL.</li><br><li> <b>Limitations and Challenges</b>: For completeness, discussing any limitations encountered during the experiments or potential challenges that could impact reproducibility is vital. This may include mentioning datasets that were particularly difficult to work with, any data that could not be shared due to privacy restrictions, or models that required significant computational resources.</li><br></ol>In conclusion, to fulfill the NeurIPS guidelines on reproducibility, the authors need to significantly improve the documentation of their experimental procedures, configurations, and data handling practices.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The provided answer (NA) and corresponding justification are missing, which indicates the authors failed to address the checklist question about whether the paper includes the full text of instructions given to participants, screenshots if applicable, and details about compensation for crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects.<br>Given the nature of the paper's topic, "Lessons learned from the AutoML challenge", it's essential to evaluate whether the inclusion of this information is necessary. The paper discusses an automated machine learning challenge, which may not involve traditional crowdsourcing or human subject research in the standard sense (as it involves code submission and automated evaluation). However, if any aspect of the challenge involved direct human participation outside of coding submissions (for instance, if human evaluators were part of the process or if any data labeling was crowd-sourced), then this information should be adequately disclosed.<br><h3>Actionable Feedback</h3><br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Involvement of Human Subjects</b>: Explicitly articulate whether any phase of the AutoML challenge involved human subjects beyond the submission of algorithms. This clarification will help determine the applicability of the checklist question to your paper.</li><br><li> <b>Participant Compensation Details</b>: If human subjects were involved in any capacity (e.g., data labeling or evaluation), include a section detailing how participants were compensated, adhering to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics regarding minimum wage compensation.</li><br><li> <b>Instructions and Interaction Details</b>: Should there have been interactions with human subjects, provide the full text or a comprehensive summary of instructions given to participants. If applicable, screenshots depicting interfaces used by participants (e.g., submission portals or instructions webpage) should be included in supplemental materials.</li><br><li> <b>Supplemental Material Use</b>: Consider using supplemental material to include extensive details that may overload the main body of the paper. Ensure these materials are easily accessible and clearly referenced within the main paper.</li><br><li> <b>Ethical Considerations Section</b>: Add a section discussing ethical considerations, especially if human subjects were involved at any stage. This section could also clarify why certain details (e.g., compensation specifics or instructions) are not applicable if that's the case.</li><br><li> <b>Revision of Justification</b>: Regardless of the NA answer, provide a justification based on the content and nature of the AutoML challenge. This justification should clarify the absence of human subjects in traditional research roles or confirm their involvement and the measures taken to comply with ethical guidelines.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors will ensure their paper aligns with NeurIPS guidelines on reporting practices for experiments involving human subjects, even if indirectly through the organization of challenges or use of crowd-sourced datasets.<br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The "Answer" provided by the authors is "NA," indicating that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects, thus Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval or discussion of potential risks to study participants was deemed not applicable. However, upon close examination of the paper content, there is no explicit engagement with human participants, personal data collection, or user studies that would typically necessitate an IRB review. The "Paper" focuses on a post-hoc analysis of the AutoML challenge, dealing with automated machine learning systems, dataset analysis, and code submissions, without direct human subject research.<br>Feedback to improve paper quality:<br><ol><li> Clarification: Add a short section or statement explicitly clarifying why IRB approval was not sought or needed. Even though the paper deals with an analysis of a challenge and uses datasets, it's important to address the NA answer by stating that the study did not directly involve human participants or use sensitive personal data where ethical review would be required.</li><br><li> Risk Discussion: Though not directly involving human subjects, discussing any potential indirect risks or ethical considerations associated with the use of machine learning systems, especially regarding biases in the datasets, fairness, and transparency of the algorithms, can strengthen the paper. This can align with the broader ethical and societal implications of machine learning research.</li><br><li> Data Privacy and Protection: If any dataset used in the analysis could potentially contain personal or sensitive information—even indirectly—it's beneficial to state the measures taken to ensure privacy and protection. This can include anonymization techniques or referencing the original dataset providers' ethical protocols.</li><br><li> Future Guidelines: As the paper contributes to the field of AutoML, providing guidelines or suggestions for future challenges on considering ethical aspects, IRB approvals when applicable, and responsible AI can enhance its impact. Highlighting these considerations can prompt future researchers and challenge organizers to plan for ethical reviews and participant protection when designing similar studies.</li><br><li> Clear Justification: For completeness, the justification for "NA" should briefly elaborate that the analysis was performed on challenge data and code submissions without any direct intervention, interaction with participants, or manipulation that involves ethical concerns pertaining to human subjects research.</li><br><br></ol></div>
