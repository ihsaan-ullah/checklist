For instance, if the paper claims to present a large-scale study examining citation bias in peer review, the authors should reference the "Methods" and "Results" sections where the study design and findings are detailed.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Contributions:</b> The authors should ensure that the paper's introduction clearly delineates its unique contributions compared to existing literature on citation bias. Specific references to the "Related Literature" and "Our contributions" sections would be helpful in justifying the novelty and relevance of the study.</li><br><li> <b>Address Scope Appropriately:</b> The authors need to ensure that the scope mentioned in the abstract and introduction is consistent with the content and findings of the paper. If the paper explores citation bias across different academic fields or conferences, this scope should be clearly reflected in the "Discussion" or "Conclusion" sections.</li><br><li> <b>Inclusion of Limitations:</b> Although not directly asked in the question, discussing the limitations of their work in relation to the claimed contributions can strengthen the authors’ credibility. This discussion should be easily identifiable in the paper, likely in a "Limitations" subsection within "Discussion" or "Conclusion."</li><br><li> <b>Review for Overstatements:</b> The authors should critically assess whether any claims made in the abstract or introduction might be perceived as overstatements of the paper's findings. Adjustments should be made to ensure that the claims are fully supported by the empirical evidence presented in the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Improve Transparency:</b> Including a transparent discussion about how the study's findings contribute to the current understanding of citation bias in peer review - and the implications of these findings - can better align the introduction and abstract claims with the paper's contributions and scope.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors can improve the alignment between their paper’s claimed contributions and scope with the actual content, enhancing its coherence and reception by the conference's reviewers and attendees.<br></div>

Given the detailed explanation in the provided content and based on the guidelines for addressing this specific checklist question, here's an organized feedback to ensure compliance and enhance the quality of the paper:<br><ol><li> <b>Clarity and Depth of Limitations</b>: Ensure the limitations section provides a comprehensive and transparent account of potential weaknesses, including but not limited to the methodological limitations, the scope of generalizability for the findings, and any specific conditions or contexts in which the results might not hold.</li><br><li> <b>Assumptions Discussed</b>: Verify that all underlying assumptions in the methodologies used are acknowledged and discussed regarding their potential impact on the findings and interpretations.</li><br><li> <b>Potential for Bias</b>: The paper should discuss any sources of bias, especially those related to the peer review and citation analysis processes. Given the nature of the study, it would be vital to assess the reflexivity in the research process and address how any biases inherent in the authors' positions or methodologies have been addressed or mitigated.</li><br><li> <b>Data Representativeness and Limitations</b>: Confirm the paper fully discusses the representativeness of the data used in the study, including any limitations due to sample size, selection criteria, and potential impacts on the study's generalizability.</li><br><li> <b>Implications of Findings</b>: While not a limitation per se, contextualizing the limitations within the broader implications of the study's findings would be beneficial. This could include discussing how the limitations might affect the interpretation of the results and any recommendations for future research or policy derived from the study.</li><br><li> <b>Future Directions</b>: Accompany the limitations with suggestions for future research that could address these limitations. This may include proposing specific methodologies, data sets, or analytical techniques that future studies could use to build on the current work.</li><br><li> <b>Ethical Considerations</b>: If not already included, ensure any ethical considerations, especially those pertinent to the study's limitations, are discussed. This includes, but is not limited to, considerations around privacy, consent, and the potential impact of the findings on the communities or subjects involved.</li><br></ol>Feedback focused on these areas would significantly augment the paper's quality and transparency, demonstrating thoroughness in addressing the research's limitations.<br><br></div>

This includes assumptions about reviewer independence, linearity of models, and matching procedures in non-parametric analysis.- Offer a dedicated section or appendix that discusses the theoretical basis of the chosen statistical methods and any potential limitations stemming from these theoretical choices.<br><ol><li> <b>Provide Rationale for Theoretical Choices:</b></li></ol>- Justify the selection of specific statistical models and tests in the context of your study objectives. Explain how these choices align with the nature of your data and the hypothesis you are testing.- Discuss the implications of your theoretical framework on the interpretation of your results. This is particularly important given the observational design of your study and its reliance on statistical inference.<br><ol><li> <b>Revise the Answer or Justification Based on Theoretical Inclusion:</b></li></ol>- Correct the initial response to reflect the presence of theoretical content in the paper. Consider a more nuanced response that acknowledges the theoretical underpinnings of your statistical analysis and study design, even if traditional "theoretical results" like new mathematical theorems are not present.- Update the paper to include a reference to the sections or appendices where these theoretical frameworks and assumptions are discussed.<br><br></div>

Ensure that the methods section clearly describes the calculation of error bars or standard errors, including any assumptions made (such as data normality).</li><br><li> <b>Clarification on Statistical Tests</b>: The paper should clearly describe the statistical tests used for determining the significance of the reported results. Specifically, while p-values are mentioned, it's important to detail the types of tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) that were applied, including any assumptions of these tests and how they align with the data characteristics.</li><br><li> <b>Detailing Factors of Variability</b>: The guidelines underline the importance of stating the factors of variability captured by the error bars. The paper should explicitly articulate these aspects, whether it's variability due to different initializations, random sampling of data, or variations across multiple runs of experiments. Including this information would significantly enhance the understanding of the results’ robustness.</li><br><li> <b>Assumptions and Data Distribution</b>: The assumption of normally distributed errors is critical when deciding on the error bar representation. If the errors are not normally distributed, the paper should provide an explanation of how this aspect was handled or considered in the analysis, perhaps by using other forms of data representation or statistical measures that better capture the distribution characteristics.</li><br><li> <b>Reference to Figures and Tables</b>: Ensure that all figures and tables that include error bars or show results with statistical significance are explicitly referenced in the text where these results are discussed. This would help readers easily locate the visual representation of the data supporting the text-based findings.</li><br><li> <b>Improvement in Data Visualization</b>: If error bars are not suitably incorporated in the currently provided figures or tables, action should be taken to revise these visual elements. This could include adding error bars to graphs, ensuring they are symmetric or asymmetric based on the actual data distribution, and adding legends or notes that explain what these error bars represent (e.g., standard deviation, standard error, confidence intervals).</li><br><li> <b>Discussion on Result Interpretation</b>: Incorporate a discussion that explicitly interprets the results in the context of the stated error bars or statistical significance measures. This discussion should address how the variability affects the conclusions drawn from the data and the extent to which these results support the paper's main claims.</li><br></ol>To summarize, enhancing the transparency and explicit detailing of statistical measures used in the paper, including error bars and their calculations, will strengthen the credibility and clarity of the presented results.

This will offer clear evidence that not only was the Code of Ethics reviewed but was also actively considered and adhered to throughout their research. For example, they could discuss how they dealt with data privacy concerns, consent, and the ethical use of AI in Section 3 "Methods" and Section 4 "Results", if applicable.</li><br><li> <b>Detail Ethical Considerations in the Experimental Design</b>: Given the observational study's potential impact on perceptions of peer review integrity, it is paramount to thoroughly discuss ethical considerations specific to their experimental design in Section 3 "Methods". The authors should explain any potential ethical risks identified and how they were mitigated. This might include measures taken to ensure that reviewer and author anonymity was maintained or how the findings were communicated to prevent misuse.</li><br><li> <b>Address the Use of Data and Participant Consent</b>: If the paper involves human data (from reviewers and authors), the authors should clarify how this data was collected and used, ensuring it aligns with the ethical use of data as per the NeurIPS guidelines. This information is crucial and should be explicitly stated, potentially in Section 3.1 "Experimental Procedure". If consent was obtained from individuals whose data was studied (even if retrospectively in the case of public or archival data), this needs to be clearly outlined.</li><br><li> <b>Discuss Potential Misuse of Research Findings</b>: Research on citation bias in peer review could inadvertently encourage manipulative citing practices if not carefully positioned. Section 5 "Discussion" should explicitly discuss potential misuses of their research findings and offer guidance on ethical citation practices. This proactive approach will demonstrate a thorough consideration of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, particularly regarding the responsible dissemination of research findings.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify the Review and Approval Process</b>: The paper vaguely mentions that the "experiment was reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board" in the acknowledgments. The authors should provide more details about this process, including any ethical review conducted, in the experimental sections of the paper. This will reinforce the responsible execution of research, in line with ethical standards.</li><br><li> <b>Expand the Justification for Ethical Compliance</b>: Lastly, the authors should not only state compliance but also critically engage with the ethical dimensions of their study in the context of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. This could involve a dedicated subsection in the "Discussion" where the implications of their findings are considered against the backdrop of ethical research conduct and publication practices in AI and machine learning.</li><br></ol>These suggested improvements, when addressed, will significantly elevate the ethical rigor of the paper and ensure full compliance with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.</div>

If so, documentation for these procedural assets should be included or referenced explicitly in the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Description of Tools and Methodology:</b> Assuming the tools or methodologies used for data collection (e.g., the custom parsing tool mentioned for identifying citation relationships) are novel contributions of this work, these should be detailed in the methodology section. This includes the algorithm or approach for matching reviewers to papers based on citations, handling data missingness, and ensuring the reliability of citation identification. Specifications on how the tool avoids false positives/negatives in identifying cited reviewers could be considered as valuable documentation accompanying the study.</li><br><li> <b>Anonymized Data Release:</b> While the primary data (reviews and reviewer identities) cannot be shared due to confidentiality, the authors might consider releasing anonymized datasets of their findings, especially the aggregated data on citation bias effect sizes, without revealing specific identities or submissions. This would allow for secondary analysis by other researchers and increase the trust in the original findings.</li><br><li> <b>Licensing and Limitations:</b> If any software was developed as part of the study, the authors should provide information on licensing, limitations of the tool, and guidelines for use by other researchers. This would also apply to any novel statistical methodologies or simulation scripts developed for the analysis.</li><br><li> <b>Documentation on Ethical Considerations:</b> The method section briefly mentions IRB approval, which is commendable. Expanding on ethical considerations, especially on the consent obtained or presumed from reviewers and authors for this kind of meta-analysis, would enrich the documentation of the study.</li><br><li> <b>Addressing the NA Answer:</b> While the initial 'NA' answer is technically correct under the traditional view of assets, the authors should re-evaluate their contributions to consider if procedural methodologies and tools introduced in their study could be viewed as assets in the broader sense of supporting reproducibility and transparency in research methods.</li><br></ol></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors have correctly marked the question as NA ("not applicable") since their study focuses on observational data concerning citation bias in peer review processes and does not involve crowdsourcing experiments or research with human subjects in the manner typically associated with experimental psychology or social sciences. The mentioned observational study relies on the analysis of data from the review processes of two conferences without direct interaction with human subjects in the form of experiments where instructions and compensation details would be relevant. Therefore, the requirements to include full text of instructions given to participants, screenshots, and compensation details do not apply here.<br>However, to ensure full compliance with the Review Process Checklist and further improve the paper's quality and clarity concerning ethical considerations, the authors could consider the following actionable feedback based on the NeurIPS guidelines:<br><ol><li> Ethical Considerations Reflection: Although not directly applicable, it would strengthen the paper to include a brief section or statement reflecting on any ethical considerations related to the observational study, especially since it deals with citation practices that could influence peer review processes and, by extension, career trajectories in academia.</li><br><li> Data Privacy and Anonymization: Clarify how the data was anonymized and confirm that there was no risk of identifying the participants (reviewers and authors) within the observational study. This is particularly relevant given the study's focus on potentially sensitive aspects of the peer-review process.</li><br><li> Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval: If applicable, mention whether the observational study of citation bias received any form of ethical review or exemption from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or equivalent ethics committee. This would provide reassurance that the study was conducted in accordance with ethical research practices.</li><br><li> Conference Collaboration Detail: Expand on the nature of collaboration with the conferences (ICML 2020 and EC 2021) and ensure that there was full compliance and agreement with using the review data for this study, highlighting any ethical guidelines followed by these conferences that pertain to data use.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the paper would not only adhere more closely to NeurIPS guidelines but also reassure readers that all ethical implications and privacy concerns related to handling sensitive review data were thoroughly considered and addressed.<br><br></div>

                <p><strong class="question">Question # 15:</strong> Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?</p>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer and justification generally adhere to the guidelines, mentioning that IRB approval was obtained and referenced in the Acknowledgments section. However, some critical elements are missing for a comprehensive review in alignment with the specific checklist question regarding the description of potential risks, disclosure to study participants, and IRB approvals.<br>Feedback for Improvement:<ol><li> <b>Explicit Disclosure of Potential Risks</b>: The authors should detail any potential risks encountered by study participants within the paper, ideally in a dedicated section or within the methodology. This is crucial for transparency and ethical rigor, even if risks are minimal.</li><br><li> <b>Details of Disclosure to Participants</b>: It should be explicitly stated how and what was disclosed to the study participants regarding the potential risks. This could include the process of informed consent or any measures taken to mitigate the identified risks. Simply stating that IRB approval was obtained is not sufficient to infer full compliance with ethical standards.</li><br><li> <b>Specifics of IRB Approval</b>: While mentioning IRB approval in the Acknowledgments is a good practice, the paper should also include specific details about the IRB approval process in the methodology section. This includes the IRB identifier, any conditions or stipulations made by the IRB, and how the study complied with these conditions. This adds to the credibility and replicability of the research.</li><br><li> <b>Inclusion of Ethics Statement</b>: The paper should include an ethics statement or subsection within the methodology section. This statement should cover the IRB approval, the consent process, and any potential risks and mitigation strategies, providing a concise yet comprehensive view of the ethical considerations of the study.</li><br><li> <b>Avoiding Assumptions on Reader's Part</b>: The authors assume readers will infer ethical adherence from the brief mention of IRB approval. A more detailed account ensures the reader does not have to make such assumptions and directly understands the ethical landscape of the study.</li><br><li> <b>Anonymity and Privacy Considerations</b>: Considering the study involves human subjects research, even if indirectly through data analysis, ensure that privacy and confidentiality measures are explicitly discussed. This is significant if identifiable information could be inferred from the data.</li><br></ol>Conclusion:The paper requires improvements to explicitly address the ethical considerations and IRB protocols as per the guidelines. Incorporating these details will not only fulfill the checklist requirement but also enhance the paper's integrity and ethical rigor.<br></div>
