However, the justification provided by the authors does not specifically point to sections in the paper where these claims are directly supported or evidenced. This oversight does not align with the guidelines requiring clear references to specific sections substantiating the claims.<br><h3>Actionable Feedback:</h3><br><ol><li> <b>Directly Link Claims to Specific Sections:</b> Revise the justification to include explicit references to the sections of the paper where the main claims are discussed in detail. This could involve pointing out where in the paper the contributions of the AutoML challenge are enumerated, where detailed findings from the challenge are presented, and where the implications of these findings for future research are discussed.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Scope and Contributions in the Abstract:</b> Ensure that the abstract clearly summarizes the key contributions and scope. If the abstract currently does not explicitly state the main findings from the AutoML challenge or how these findings advance the field of machine learning, consider revising for clarity and specificity.</li><br><li> <b>Enhance the Introduction for Better Context:</b> In the introduction, aside from covering the background, objectives, and the significance of the AutoML challenge, it would be helpful to briefly mention the paper's contributions to providing insights or lessons learned from the challenge. This sets the reader's expectations correctly for what is covered in the subsequent sections.</li><br><li> <b>Address Any Overstatements or Aspirational Goals:</b> If the paper includes aspirational goals or hypotheses as part of its claims, clarify in the introduction or abstract which specific goals were met and which remain aspirational. This ensures that claims accurately reflect the paper’s content and contribute to setting realistic expectations for the readers.</li><br><li> <b>Summarize Findings in the Conclusion:</b> Ensure that the concluding section of the paper clearly restates the paper’s main contributions and findings, aligning them with the claims made in the abstract and introduction. This helps reinforce how the paper's contents fulfill the initial promises made to the reader.</li><br></ol>By implementing these improvements, the paper will be better aligned with the guidelines and ensure that the claims made in the abstract and introduction are accurately supported by the content within the specific sections of the document.<br></div>

Based on the content provided, it is not clear if these aspects are fully covered in the mentioned section.<br>Itemized, actionable feedback for improvement:<ul><li>Ensure that the discussion of limitations includes a reflection on strong assumptions made during the research. Identify any assumptions about data distribution, feature representation, or computational resources that could limit the generalizability of the findings.</li><li>Discuss the robustness of the proposed AutoML solutions to violations of the assumptions mentioned. For example, how would changes in data distribution or quality impact the performance of the winning algorithms?</li><li>Clarify the scope of the claims made in the paper. Given that the challenge focused on a specific set of tasks under controlled conditions, caution should be exercised in generalizing the results to all AutoML scenarios.</li><li>Reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. Given the complexity of AutoML challenges, certain algorithms may perform better under specific conditions (e.g., data size, feature types). This discussion can add depth and context to the limitations section.</li><li>If not already included, the paper should mention the computational efficiency of different AutoML solutions and their scalability, which is crucial for real-world application.</li><br></ul>Addressing these points can strengthen the paper by providing a more comprehensive overview of its limitations and ensuring transparency about the work's scope and applicability.

However, an examination of the paper content is necessary to verify this claim accurately. Given the detailed nature of the paper's content focused on the analysis of an AutoML challenge, findings, and discussions on methodologies including heuristic searches, Bayesian optimization, meta-learning, and the effectiveness of ensemble methods, the paper primarily presents empirical results and analysis rather than deriving theoretical results or proofs. Thus, the answer provided by the authors aligns well with the content presented in the paper, as the primary focus is on empirical analysis and summarization of findings from the AutoML challenge, without an explicit focus on developing or proving new theoretical results.<br>Based on the guidelines provided for authors, if a paper does not include theoretical results, answering "NA" to the question regarding the provision of a full set of assumptions and complete proofs is appropriate. The paper is structured to discuss methodologies, empirical findings, and analyses derived from the AutoML challenge, rather than developing or proving theoretical concepts from a mathematical standpoint. It did not delve into theoretical formulations that require assumptions, theorems, or mathematical proofs, thus making "NA" a suitable answer.<br>Itemized, actionable feedback to improve the paper quality could involve:<ol><li> Clarification within the paper to explicitly state the absence of theoretical results, ensuring readers are aware that the focus is on empirical analysis and insight derived from the AutoML challenge.</li><li> Providing a section that discusses the implications of the empirical findings on existing theoretical frameworks or a brief discussion on how these findings could inspire future theoretical investigation.</li><li> Including a disclaimer or a brief paragraph in the methodology or conclusion sections regarding the scope of the paper focusing on empirical results and lessons learned without delving into theoretical proof development.</li><br></ol>These improvements can help to set clear expectations for readers regarding the content of the paper and its contributions to the field of AutoML, reinforcing the rationale behind the "NA" response to the question about theoretical results and proofs.<br><br></div>

However, upon careful examination of the answer and justification against the actual content of the paper, several key points need to be addressed to ensure clarity, completeness, and compliance with the guidelines:<br><ol><li> <b>Precise Location of Material</b>: The authors stated that all necessary material (code, datasets, and instructions) is provided at a URL mentioned in the abstract. According to the guidelines, while mentioning the URL can be helpful, it is crucial to also point out specific sections within the paper where related material for reproduction can be found. Merely pointing to an external URL in the abstract might not suffice for reproducibility if the paper itself does not elaborate on how the experiments can be reproduced based on the provided resources.</li><br><li> <b>Reproducibility Details</b>: Even though the URL for accessing the code and datasets is stated, the paper should also discuss any prerequisites, environment details (software versions, operating systems, hardware requirements), and exact commands or scripts that are needed to reproduce the results. This is essential to fulfill the reproducibility criteria defined in the guidelines.</li><br><li> <b>Clarity on Reproducible Components</b>: The authors must clarify if all experimental results presented in the paper can be reproduced with the provided code and datasets. If there are any exceptions (e.g., some results are based on proprietary data or require computational resources that might not be widely accessible), these should be explicitly stated.</li><br><h3>Actionable Feedback:</h3><br><li> <b>Section References</b>: Amend the paper to include references to specific sections discussing the open access of data and code, and the reproducibility of the experiments. If such sections do not exist, they should be created to detail the content and instructions necessary for replication.</li><br><li> <b>Reproducibility Instructions</b>: Enhance the supplemental material or an appendix within the paper to offer detailed instructions for reproducing the experiments. This includes environment setup, data preparation steps, and execution commands.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Reproducibility Scope</b>: Clearly specify which parts of the experimental analysis are reproducible with the provided resources and disclose any limitations, such as experiments needing proprietary datasets or significant computational resources.</li><br><li> <b>External Resources</b>: Besides providing a URL in the abstract, consider embedding supplementary files or an appendix within the paper submission that contains necessary scripts, with proper anonymization to adhere to the double-blind review process.</li><br><li> <b>Environment Details</b>: Include detailed information about the software and hardware used for the experiments to assist with the accurate replication of the results. This might involve specifying versions of programming languages, libraries, operating systems, and the computational capacity needed.</li><br></ol>Following this feedback to address the noted discrepancies and making the paper more aligned with NeurIPS guidelines will enhance the clarity, completeness, and reproducibility of the research presented.<br></div>

For instance, models capable of automated decision-making can be repurposed in ways that the authors might not have intended.</li><br><li> <b>Describe Safeguards in Detail</b>: If after careful consideration, the authors conclude certain risks are associated with their release, these should be explicitly stated alongside the safeguards that have been put in place. This could involve restrictions on use, ethical guidelines for use, or mechanisms to monitor the usage of released data or models. If external datasets have been utilized, the terms of their licenses and any compliance measures should also be described.</li><br><li> <b>Clarification in Text</b>: The section in the paper discussing the release (all datasets, code of the winners, and challenge results are found at an openly accessible URL) should include a paragraph explicitly addressing the absence or presence of safeguards related to responsible data and model release.

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> Itemized, actionable feedback based on the guidelines and given the provided content:<br><ol><li> Clarify Involvement of Human Subjects or Data: Given the nature of the "AutoML challenge," the answer "NA" to the question regarding the involvement of crowdsourcing or research with human subjects seems appropriate. However, it is essential to explicitly state whether any part of the challenge or the analysis involved indirect use of human-generated data, even if participants did not directly interact with human subjects. If there was any use of datasets derived from human subjects, this should be clarified, even though direct interaction was not part of the research methodology.</li><br><li> Detail on Datasets Used: While the paper discusses the AutoML challenge, including the datasets used in the challenge, the authors need to ensure that there is clear information on the origin of these datasets, especially if any could potentially include data derived from human subjects. This could involve a brief statement on the nature and sourcing of the datasets to preclude ethical or privacy concerns.</li><br><li> Ethical Considerations and Acknowledgment: Given that the paper deals with an analysis of a challenge that likely involved many participants and potentially datasets derived from human contributions, it would strengthen the paper to include a statement on ethical considerations. This could cover both the treatment of data and the acknowledgment of participants' efforts in a manner that respects their contributions and privacy.</li><br><li> Compensation Disclosure: Even if the question seems not applicable, if there was any form of compensation or recognition given to participants of the AutoML challenge, it should be disclosed. This could include awards, recognition in publications, or other forms of incentives. A brief note on this aspect would address the guideline's requirement regarding compensation.</li><br><li> Supplement Material for Comprehensive Understanding: If there are any instructional materials, competition guidelines, or additional resources that were provided to the challenge participants, considering including these in the supplementary materials for the paper. This would provide readers with a comprehensive view of the challenge's setup and execution, adding depth to the paper's analysis.</li><br><li> Transparency and Reproducibility: Ensure that the paper maintains a high level of transparency about the methods used in analyzing the AutoML challenge. This includes clear references to any code, algorithms, or analytical tools derived from the challenge. The objective is to allow others in the research community to understand, replicate, or extend the work done in analyzing the AutoML challenge outcomes.</li><br><br></ol></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer of "NA" seems to be justified and correct based on the content of the paper, which describes an AutoML challenge that involves code submissions rather than human participation or crowdsourcing. Since the focus is on algorithmic challenges and automated processes for solving machine learning tasks, there does not appear to be direct involvement of human subjects or participants in a manner that would typically necessitate IRB review or the identification of potential risks to study participants.<br>Given that the paper strictly discusses the results and analyses of an AutoML challenge, and unless there are undisclosed elements of human research or data collection that could pose risks to individuals (not evident from the provided text), the authors' response aligns well with the guidelines for disclosing potential risks and obtaining IRB approval.<br><b>Feedback for Improvement:</b><ol><li> Clarify Involvement of Human Data: Even though the paper centers on algorithmic development and benchmarking within an AutoML challenge, if any datasets employed in the challenge or for the purpose of testing the algorithms involve human subjects indirectly (e.g., datasets containing personal data collected from individuals), it would enhance the paper to clarify the ethical considerations around the use of such data. The authors should affirm whether all datasets comply with ethical standards and legal requirements concerning the privacy and consent of any individuals whose data might have been included.</li><br><li> Transparency on Dataset Origins and Permissions: While not directly related to risks to study participants, offering detailed transparency regarding the origins of datasets, permissions to use them, and any anonymization or privacy-preserving measures taken would strengthen the ethical rigor of the study. This also indirectly ties to participant risk if any of the datasets were derived from human subjects.</li><br><li> Detailed Ethics Statement: Even for studies marked "NA" concerning direct human participation, including a detailed ethics statement regarding the broader implications of the research, such as potential societal impacts and misuse of the technology, adds depth to the manuscript. This could cover considerations beyond direct participant risks, looking at how the developed algorithms might be used or misused in practice.</li><br><li> Risk Assessment of Indirect Effects: Briefly assess any indirect risks or consequences of the automated systems being developed, including biases in algorithmic decisions or impacts on job sectors. While outside the purview of traditional IRB considerations, these acknowledgments reflect thoughtfulness about the broader impacts of AutoML developments.</li><br></ol><b>Conclusion:</b>The justification provided by the authors for marking the IRB question as "NA" is appropriate given the information available. However, incorporating the recommended enhancements could augment the paper’s acknowledgment of ethical considerations, ensuring comprehensive coverage of both direct and indirect implications of the research.<br></div>
