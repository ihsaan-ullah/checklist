            </div>
            
            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer and justification generally align with the contents of the paper; however, there's a noticeable lack of specificity in their justification. According to the guidelines, the authors are required to point to specific sections where related material can be found to substantiate their claims. While they assert that the abstract and introduction clearly state the paper's main contributions and scope, they fail to reference particular sections that elaborate on these points, which is pivotal for reviewers to efficiently verify these claims.<br>Feedback to improve the paper quality:<ol><li> Specify Sections in Justification: Enhance the justification by precisely indicating the sections where the paper elaborates on its main claims, contributions, and scope. For instance, the authors could amend their justification to say, "The paper's main contributions and scope are expanded upon in Sections 2 (Design of the First Round) and 3 (Analyses of the First Round Results), which detail the methodology and findings from applying our novel approach to meta-learning through Genetic Algorithms."</li><li> Align Claims with Content: Ensure that all claims made in the abstract and introduction are directly reflected and supported in the paper's main body. If the introduction mentions a significant step forward in the field of meta-learning, the discussion or conclusion section should elaborate on why this is the case. If this is not currently done to a satisfactory level, the paper should be revised to either adjust the claims or add the necessary supporting arguments and evidence.</li><li> Clarify the Scope: If the paper’s scope is broader or narrower than what typical readers might infer from the abstract and introduction, clarify this within the introduction section. For instance, if the paper focuses on a specific subset of meta-learning strategies, explicitly stating so helps set the right expectations.</li><li> Contributions Listing: Consider adding a bullet-point list of contributions towards the end of the introduction for clearer visibility. This could help readers quickly grasp the paper's value proposition and how it advances the field.</li><li> Address Limitations: While the guidelines suggest that it's acceptable to include aspirational goals, ensure that any limitations or areas where these goals were not fully achieved are transparently discussed in the conclusion section. This honesty enhances the paper's credibility and helps guide future research.</li><br></ol>Concluding, the paper would benefit significantly from explicitly linking its claims to specific sections that bolster these assertions, thereby making it easier for reviewers and readers to understand and evaluate the paper's contributions.<br><br></div>

However, it is crucial to evaluate whether their discussion fully adheres to the guidelines outlined for acknowledging limitations, which emphasize the importance of discussing strong assumptions, the robustness of results, the scope of claims, factors influencing performance, computational efficiency, and considerations of privacy and fairness if applicable.<br>Feedback to improve the paper quality based on the guidelines:<br><ol><li> <b>Expand on Assumptions and Robustness</b>: While the paper discusses the limitations in the design of the challenge, it does not explicitly address the strong assumptions behind their methods or how robust their findings are to the violations of these assumptions. The authors might benefit from reflecting on any assumptions made in the meta-learning approach or in the evaluation metrics, and discuss their potential impact if proven invalid.</li><br><li> <b>Scope of Claims</b>: The paper would benefit from a more critical examination of the scope of its claims, especially concerning the generalizability of the findings beyond the datasets and algorithms tested in the challenge. Discussing the limitations related to the diversity of datasets and algorithms can help in tempering the claims made and setting proper expectations for the readers.</li><br><li> <b>Factors Influencing Performance</b>: The authors should delve deeper into the factors that influence the performance of their meta-learning approach. For instance, how might variations in dataset characteristics or algorithm hyperparameters affect the outcomes? Addressing these considerations can provide a fuller picture of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach.</li><br><li> <b>Computational Efficiency</b>: Although the paper mentions the computational resources used in the challenge, there is a lack of discussion regarding the computational efficiency of their meta-learning approach and its scalability. Including a discussion on this aspect could significantly enhance the understanding of the practical implications of their work, especially in terms of resource consumption and applicability to larger datasets.</li><br><li> <b>Address Limitations on Privacy and Fairness</b>: If applicable, the authors should consider any limitations their approach might have in terms of privacy and fairness. Even if these issues may not be directly relevant to their challenge, acknowledging their potential importance in the broader context of AI systems can contribute to a more comprehensive discussion of limitations.</li><br></ol>By addressing these feedback points, the authors will be able to provide a more thorough and insightful discussion of the limitations of their work, in line with the best practices for scientific reporting. This will not only enhance the quality of the paper but also contribute positively to the transparency and integrity of the research process.<br><br></div>

Upon review of the paper content, the paper indeed embarks on presenting a new approach to meta-learning through Genetic Algorithms, emphasizing an empirical analysis related to optimizing algorithm selection based on performance trajectories. This primarily involves experimentation and analysis rather than theorem-proving or theoretical development in the traditional mathematical sense.<br>Given the nature and content of the paper, which is focused on empirical meta-learning challenges, design iterations, and the application of various strategies for algorithm selection and budget allocation without delving into the formulation and proof of new theoretical results, the author's response aligns with the content and scope of the paper.<br><b>Actionable Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Empirical Focus:</b> Reinforce in the introduction or methodology sections that the research emphasis is on empirical exploration and analysis. This clarification will preemptively address expectations related to theoretical contributions.</li><br><li> <b>Explicit Statement:</b> To avoid potential ambiguity, consider adding a brief explicit statement early in the paper noting the empirical nature of the work and specifying that it does not engage with theoretical model derivation or proof formulation. This will directly address the checklist question and prevent misinterpretation of the paper’s scope.</li><br><li> <b>Reference Relevant Work:</b> Even though the paper is empirically focused, if there are theoretical frameworks or assumptions underlying any part of the methodology, ensure these are briefly mentioned and correctly referenced. This acknowledges the theoretical underpinnings without requiring new proofs or derivations.</li><br><li> <b>Supplemental Materials:</b> If there are any theoretical aspects not fully explored in the paper due to its empirical focus, but which could enrich the understanding of your approach (e.g., a mathematical model describing the genetic algorithm's selection process), consider including these in the appendix or supplemental materials. This is optional but can be valuable for readers interested in the theoretical basis of empirical methodologies.</li><br><li> <b>Consistency Check:</b> Verify that all sections of the paper consistently reflect the empirical nature of the research. Any mention of "results" should clearly be contextualized as empirical findings rather than theoretical proofs, to maintain alignment with the answer provided to the checklist question.</li><br></ol>These improvements should help better position the paper within its empirical research domain and ensure that readers clearly understand the nature of its contributions without expecting theoretical results that the paper does not aim to provide.<br></div>

This includes specifying the required software environment, dependencies, and exact commands to run the experiments. If specific datasets are private, provide sample or synthetic data and detailed instructions on how the data format is structured so researchers can generate or use alternative datasets.</li><br><li> <b>Explanation of Data Privacy</b>: Elaborate on the reasons for keeping some datasets private. If the privacy is due to ethical considerations, proprietary constraints, or ongoing benchmarking efforts, clarify these points. Providing a rationale helps the community understand the constraints and fosters trust in the research methodology.</li><br><li> <b>Alternative Access Options</b>: If possible, offer a mechanism for researchers to request access to the private data under specific conditions, e.g., a data usage agreement. This could potentially increase the impact of the work by allowing other researchers to more deeply engage with the research findings.</li><br><li> <b>Mock Data or Synthetic Data</b>: To aid in reproducibility, consider providing synthetic or sample data that mimic the characteristics of the private datasets. This allows other researchers to test the methods and understand the data requirements. Include a detailed comparison of how the synthetic data relates to the real data in terms of structure, domain, and statistical properties.</li><br><li> <b>Detailed Description of Data and Code Availability</b>: Clearly state the location of the public code repository in the paper, including any anonymized links per NeurIPS guidelines for double-blind review. Ensure the repository includes a detailed README with setup and execution instructions, license information for code reuse, and any necessary citations for the datasets used.</li><br><li> <b>Clarification on Benchmarked Results</b>: For experiments that cannot be fully reproduced due to the absence of certain datasets, provide a thorough analysis and discussion of the available results.

The authors' justification mentions that error-bars were not explicitly discussed, suggesting that no statistical measures of variability or significance were included. However, upon examining the paper content, several key points related to the statistical significance of the experiments become apparent:<br><ol><li> In the section titled "Analyses of the first round results," the paper reports ALC scores with accompanying standard deviations (e.g., "0.43±0.01") for the top methods. This indicates that some form of error measurement and variability indication is indeed reported.</li><li> The computation of the average ALC score and the standard deviation of ALC scores across datasets are mathematically outlined. This provides a methodological basis for assessing the variability of the results, directly challenging the authors' justification for their 'No' answer.</li><li> Given the reporting of standard deviations, it appears there has been an attempt to convey the statistical variation of the experiment results, which is in contradiction with the authors' proposed justification.</li><br></ol><b>Actionable Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Statistical Reporting:</b> The authors should revise the justification to accurately reflect the inclusion of standard deviations in the results. This corresponds to a form of error bar, which captures the variability of the results across different datasets.</li><br><li> <b>Expand on Statistical Significance Reporting:</b> While standard deviations are a step in the right direction, the authors could improve the paper by also including confidence intervals or conducting hypothesis tests to provide a clearer picture of the statistical significance of their results. This would align more closely with best practices in reporting experimental results.</li><br><li> <b>Clearly State the Factors of Variability:</b> The paper should explicitly mention the factors contributing to the variability captured by the reported standard deviations. Clarifying whether these factors include different train/test splits, algorithm initializations, or other conditions would enhance the reader's understanding of the results’ robustness.</li><br><li> <b>Discuss the Assumptions:</b> If the error bars (standard deviations) are used, the authors should discuss any assumptions made, such as the normality of errors. This is particularly important if the authors later consider expanding their statistical analysis to include confidence intervals or other measures that rely on specific distributional assumptions.</li><br><li> <b>Reference Error Bars in the Text:</b> To improve clarity, the authors should ensure that any mentions of variability, error bars, or statistical significance in the results sections are directly linked to the corresponding figures or tables where these are reported. This aids in reader comprehension and highlights the attention paid to statistical robustness.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the paper would provide a clearer and more comprehensive account of the statistical significance and variability of the results, thereby improving its quality and alignment with the conference submission guidelines.<br></div>

This will help readers understand the assets' context, application, or limitation directly from the paper without needing to visit the external link initially.</li><br><li> <b>Include Summary of Documentation in the Paper:</b> While it is understandable that detailed documentation might be too extensive to fully include in the paper and is more appropriate for an accompanying website, a brief summary or overview of what the documentation covers should be provided within the paper. For instances, details on dataset characteristics, models' architecture specifics, code functionalities, or a high-level summary of the assets can be very useful for readers.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Asset Access and Anonymization:</b> Given the conference's requirement for anonymization at submission time, the paper should explicitly state how the assets have been anonymized for the review process and how readers can access them. If the assets are hosted on a challenge website, clarify within the paper that this link is anonymized or how it will be updated post-review process.</li><br><li> <b>Ethical Considerations and Consent for Assets Involving Human Data:</b> If any new asset involves data from human subjects, the paper should briefly discuss ethical considerations, consent process, and institutional review board (IRB) approval if applicable. Although this might be detailed in the external documentation, a summary within the paper itself will assure readers of adherence to ethical standards.</li><br><li> <b>Data and Software Section:</b> It is recommended to have a dedicated section or subsection in the paper, such as a "Software and Data" section, that addresses the availability, documentation, and any relevant information about newly introduced assets. This section should, at the very least, mention the types of documentation available (e.g., code comments, usage guides, dataset descriptions) and where to find them.</li><br></ol>By incorporating these improvements, the paper would provide clearer, more direct information about the new assets introduced, their documentation, and accessibility, aligning better with the expectations set by the question guidelines.<br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The discrepancy here is between the author's proposed answer to the checklist question regarding crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects and the content in the paper itself. The proposed answer was "NA," with the justification that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. However, within the software and data section of the paper, it mentions, "In our study, one dataset was generated through the involvement of human subjects...". This clearly indicates that human subjects were involved in a part of the research, contrary to the NA response to the checklist question.<br>Here's the actionable feedback to improve the paper quality based on this discrepancy:<br><ol><li> <b>Revise the Checklist Response</b>: The authors need to update their response to the checklist question. Since the paper mentions the involvement of human subjects in dataset generation, the appropriate answer to the checklist question is "Yes," accompanied by a reference to the section that details the procedure, compensation, and ethical considerations involved with the human subjects.</li><br><li> <b>Detail Participant Interaction</b>: Ensure the section that discusses the involvement of human subjects in dataset generation includes full text instructions provided to participants, along with screenshots if applicable. This should cover the recruitment process, the instructions given, tasks performed, and any user interface they interacted with.</li><br><li> <b>Compensation Transparency</b>: Clearly detail the compensation provided to the human subjects. This includes not only stating the amount but also the rationale for the chosen compensation scheme, aligning with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics standards.</li><br><li> <b>Ethical Approval and Consent</b>: Although mentioned briefly, it would benefit from a more detailed description of the ethical approval process, including the name of the IRB that provided approval and the consent procedure followed. Clarify how participants were briefed and their rights to withdraw without penalty.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify the Impact on Results</b>: Provide a discussion on how the data collected from human subjects impacted the research outcomes. This could include the significance of the human-generated dataset in the overall research and any insights derived specifically from this data.</li><br><li> <b>Supplemental Material</b>: If there's more detailed information on the interaction with human subjects, such as detailed instructions or data collection protocols that were not included in the main body due to space constraints, consider adding this to the supplemental material.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors will enhance the clarity, ethical transparency, and completeness of their submission, aligning it with the guidelines provided.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer indicates that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects, suggesting that risks to participants, consent disclosures, and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals are not applicable (NA). However, there is a discrepancy in the actual content of the paper, specifically under the "Software and Data" section. The paper mentions the generation of one dataset through the involvement of human subjects, detailing adherence to ethical guidelines, informed consent procurement, the opportunity for withdrawal without penalty, and compensation for participation, alongside securing IRB approvals.<br>Given this discrepancy, here is the itemized, actionable feedback aiming to improve the quality of the paper:<br><ol><li> <b>Correct the Proposed Answer</b>: Since the paper does involve human subjects in dataset generation, the appropriate answer to the question should not be "NA". The authors should correct this to "Yes" to reflect the involvement of human subjects as described.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify the Involvement of Human Subjects</b>: The explanation regarding the involvement of human subjects in the generation of a dataset is buried under the "Software and Data" section. This information should be more prominently placed or referenced in the methodology or ethical considerations sections, making the paper's adherence to ethical guidelines and IRB procedures transparent early on.</li><br><li> <b>Detailed Ethical Considerations Section</b>: Given the involvement of human subjects, the authors should include a dedicated section on Ethical Considerations. This section should detail the process of securing informed consent, the measures taken to ensure participant anonymity and data security, the compensation provided to participants, and any potential risks or discomforts, even if minimal.</li><br><li> <b>Evidence of IRB Approval</b>: While mentioning IRB approval is necessary, offering a statement or reference about the approval (without breaking the anonymity requirements for NeurIPS submissions) would provide stronger evidence of the paper's adherence to ethical research practices. If direct statements cannot be made due to anonymity, a general statement on the process and standards met can be helpful.</li><br><li> <b>Review and Update Risk Assessment</b>: The authors need to critically review and possibly update their risk assessment related to the involvement of human subjects, considering any physical, psychological, social, legal, or other risks, even if perceived as minimal. This reassessment should be documented in the paper, providing readers with a clear understanding of any potential impacts on participants.</li><br><li> <b>Consent Process Documentation</b>: More detailed documentation of the consent process should be provided, either in the main text or appendix, ensuring that readers understand how participant autonomy was respected and informed decisions were made to participate in the study.</li><br></ol>Improving these aspects will strengthen the paper's ethical considerations, transparency, and adherence to research integrity principles, addressing an essential component of conducting research involving human subjects.<br><br></div>
