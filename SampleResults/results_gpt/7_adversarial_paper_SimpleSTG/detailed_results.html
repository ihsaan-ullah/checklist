However, their justification broadly mentions that these claims are highlighted in section 1 without providing a fine-grained cross-reference within the paper to where each specific claim is substantiated. This approach could make it harder for readers to verify the claims against the provided evidence.<br><b>Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Detail Specific Sections of Contribution</b>: Rather than mentioning section 1 in a broad sense, point out exact subsections or even paragraphs where each claim is detailed. If the paper abstract claims advancements or improvements in specific aspects of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) or Neural Architecture Search (NAS), the authors should reference the sections where these advancements are experimentally validated or theoretically argued.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Contribution with Respect to Issues Highlighted</b>: Given that the abstract mentions tackling issues with existing NAS methods for STGNNs, such as integrating hyperparameters into the NAS framework and reducing the search space, it's critical to pinpoint where in the paper these solutions are proposed, and their effectiveness is demonstrated.</li><br><li> <b>Address Limitations and Assumptions</b>: If there are aspirational goals or assumptions mentioned in the abstract or introduction, ensure these are also reflected upon in the discussed sections with a clear indication of any limitations encountered, as per the guidelines.</li><br><li> <b>Improve Abstract and Introduction Consistency</b>: Ensure that the scope and contributions mentioned in the abstract and introduction are mirrored throughout the paper. If the abstract mentions surpassing state-of-the-art models, the introduction and subsequent sections should detail this comparison in depth.</li><br><li> <b>Empirical Evidence and Theoretical Justification</b>: For every main claim, there should be empirical evidence provided through experiments or theoretical justification referenced directly within the justification for the answer to this question. This will improve the paper's credibility and allow reviewers to easily assess the validity of the claims.</li><br><li> <b>Revisit the Justification Section</b>: Adding more detail to the justification section to guide readers directly to where they can find support for the claims can significantly enhance the quality and integrity of the paper.</li><br></ol>The justification provided by the authors could be enhanced by directly linking the paper's claims to specific evidences or sections within the document, which would make it easier for readers and reviewers to validate these claims against the results and discussions presented.</div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer and justification generally align with the guidelines for discussing the limitations of the work performed. They pointed out the section where the limitations are discussed and provided specific aspects covered, such as the application domain and temporal modeling methods. However, to further enhance the quality and integrity of the paper, the following feedback focusing on significant improvements is provided based on the guidelines:<br><ol><li> <b>Expand the Discussion on Limitations</b>: While Section 6 mentions potential limitations, the depth and breadth of this discussion could be improved. The authors should consider elaborating on how the limitations might affect the generalizability and applicability of their proposed models. For instance, discussing the implications of their approach in diverse datasets or under different assumptions could provide clearer insights into the potential scope of their work.</li><br><li> <b>Robustness to Assumptions</b>: The paper should critically evaluate how robust their proposed framework is to violations of underlying assumptions. For example, the authors assume the adequacy of spatial and temporal modeling within the STGNN framework but do not discuss how deviations from this assumption might impact performance. This discussion could include theoretical considerations or empirical evidence from varied datasets.</li><br><li> <b>Scalability Discussion</b>: While the authors mention simplifying the architecture search for STGNNs, the computational efficiency and scalability of their proposed methods are not adequately discussed. Especially in the context of large-scale networks or high-frequency data, these aspects are crucial for practical applications. An in-depth analysis of computational requirements, efficiency trade-offs, and scalability to larger datasets would significantly enhance the paper's value.</li><br><li> <b>Reflection on Performance Factors</b>: The paper could benefit from a more detailed reflection on factors influencing the performance of their proposed methods. Beyond architecture and hyperparameters, there might be external factors or data characteristics that significantly impact model performance. Discussing such factors and providing guidelines for practitioners on when and how their proposed framework might be best applied would be advantageous.</li><br><li> <b>Addressing Privacy and Fairness</b>: If applicable, considering the growing concern around data privacy and algorithmic fairness, the authors should reflect on these aspects concerning their framework. Even if not directly relevant to their current study, acknowledging the potential limitations and future directions regarding privacy and fairness could demonstrate responsible AI research practices.</li><br><li> <b>Enhanced Honesty in Limitation Reporting</b>: Encourage the authors to be more forthcoming about uncertainties and potential criticisms of their work. This includes a critical self-evaluation of the study's limitations and an exploration of unresolved questions that could pave the way for future research.</li><br></ol>In conclusion, addressing these areas would not only align with the best practices outlined in the guidelines but also significantly enhance the paper's contribution, clarity, and integrity, ensuring it provides a comprehensive understanding of the proposed work's strengths and limitations.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authorsâ€™ proposed answer and justification indicate a "Yes" response to the checklist question regarding whether each theoretical result provides the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof. The authors refer to Section 4 for discussions on assumptions, but the paper content overall does not explicitly delineate between the assumptions for the theoretical results and the proofs for such results in a structured manner that aligns with the guidelines' recommendations for clarity and completeness.<br><h3>Feedback for Improvement:</h3><ol><li> <b>Numbering of Theorems and Proofs:</b> Ensure all theorems, lemmas, and corresponding proofs in the paper are distinctly numbered and referenced within the text. This includes any results presented in the main body and supplementary material. This practice will facilitate easier navigation and review of the theoretical contributions of the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Clear Statement of Assumptions:</b> Each theorem or lemma should explicitly state or reference the assumptions under which the claim holds, directly at the beginning of the statement. If certain assumptions are generic across all theoretical results, consider summarizing these in a preliminary section but ensure specific references are made in each result.</li><br><li> <b>Location and Completeness of Proofs:</b> Confirm that proofs for all theoretical results are either included within the main document or clearly indicated in the supplementary material if length or detail necessitates external documentation. For proofs in the main paper, consider adding short proof sketches for intuition; for those in the supplemental, ensure thereâ€™s a direct link or clear guide on where to find these details.</li><br><li> <b>Cross-referencing Theorems and Lemmas:</b> Improve the interlinking of theoretical results by referencing dependent lemmas or previously established theorems within new proofs. This not only strengthens the narrative but also validates the reliance on earlier results.</li><br><li> <b>Guidance on Locating Assumptions and Proofs:</b> Amend the text in Section 4 or wherever the assumptions and proofs are discussed, to include explicit guidance on where the reader can find detailed proofs (e.g., "See Appendix A for the complete proof of Theorem 1"). This advice also applies to assumptions; guide the reader to specific sections or supplementary material where assumptions are elaborated.</li><br><li> <b>Assessment of Assumptions' Implications:</b> Provide a discussion on the implications of the assumptions for the practical application of the theoretical results. This includes any limitations these assumptions may impose and how they align with existing literature or real-world scenarios.</li><br></ol>In doing so, the paper would address critical elements of theoretical rigor and contribute more effectively to scholarly discourse by offering clear, accessible, and verifiable theoretical insights.<br></div>

The Answer asserts full disclosure of necessary information for reproducing the main experimental results, citing specific sections of the paper and including a GitHub link for the code. This addresses both dimensions of reproducibility: access to code and detailed methodological descriptions.<br>However, without explicit access to the actual paper content and the GitHub repository, this review cannot definitively verify the completeness of the details or the functionality of the provided code. The general expectation from a rigor point of view is that the descriptions in the cited sections (experiment settings, dataset descriptions, baseline comparisons, implementation details, and results discussion) should meet certain criteria:<br><ol><li> <b>Dataset Description:</b> Availability, preprocessing steps, partition (train/validation/test split), and any generation process for synthetic data should be clearly articulated. Especially, any non-public dataset must have a thorough description to enable replication with alternative similar datasets.</li><br><li> <b>Baseline Comparisons:</b> The reproducibility of results heavily depends on precise baseline model descriptions, including hyperparameters and any custom modifications. This ensures that comparisons are fair and reproducible.</li><br><li> <b>Implementation Details:</b> Details like the version of software/dependencies, algorithmic peculiarities not covered by pseudocode, initialization methods, and hyperparameter selection process (including any grid search or random search bounds) are essential.</li><br><li> <b>Specificity in Results Discussion:</b> For completeness, statistical validation of results (e.g., reporting mean and standard deviation across multiple runs, error bars if applicable) increases reproducibility. This also includes any deviations from expected performance and potential reasons.</li><br><li> <b>Accessibility and Usability of Provided Code:</b> The existence of a GitHub repository is positive; however, it should ideally be accompanied by a README file detailing the environment setup, dataset preparation steps, execution instructions, and a license specifying terms of use. The code should be organized and commented sufficiently to understand the implementation logic and flow.</li><br><h3>Actionable Feedback</h3><br></ol>To improve the paper quality regarding reproducibility:<br><ul><li><b>Clarify Data Accessibility:</b> Ensure that the paper explicitly states how to access all datasets used in experiments or provides detailed guidance on how to simulate any unavailable datasets.</li><li><b>Enhance Description of Baselines:</b> Include precise configuration details for all baseline models, including hyperparameters and any software versions used.</li><li><b>Expand Implementation Details:</b> Beyond algorithmic descriptions, provide insights into practical challenges encountered during implementation and how they were resolved.</li><li><b>Provide Detailed Code Documentation:</b> Enhance the GitHub repository with extensive documentation covering setup, execution, and potentially a Dockerfile to simplify environment replication.</li><li><b>Statistical Analysis of Results:</b> If not already included, augment the results section with a deeper statistical analysis to strengthen the validity of the claims.</li><br></ul>In summary, while the authors have made an affirmative statement towards reproducibility, the verification of their claim relies on the depth of the details provided in the mentioned sections and the usability of the code in the repository. Assuming all stated resources are in place and thorough, this paper would be considered to have met the NeurIPS reproducibility criteria effectively.<br></div>

However, there are several areas for improvement based on the guidelines for NeurIPS submission and standard practices for ensuring replicability and understanding of the experiments conducted. Here are the recommended improvements:<br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Hyperparameter Selection Process</b>: Though the paper mentions hyperparameters are studied, it would benefit from a more detailed explanation of how specific hyperparameters were chosen (e.g., why certain learning rates or batch sizes were preferred). Including rationale or results from preliminary experiments could enhance this section.</li><br><li> <b>More Detailed Data Splits Information</b>: The paper should specify the splits (training, validation, test) more explicitly. The exact percentage or the number of instances in each split should be provided to ensure reproducibility. If there were any stratification or special considerations made during splitting, these should be detailed.</li><br><li> <b>Optimizer Details</b>: The type of optimizer is mentioned, but additional details such as specific configurations (e.g., momentum terms for SGD if applicable, epsilon values for Adam, etc.) would be helpful. This ensures that the experiments can be replicated accurately by readers.</li><br><li> <b>Explanation of Hyperparameter Range Choices</b>: While the paper describes the exploration of hyperparameter spaces, it should also provide justification for the range or values selected for exploration. This could include references to literature or empirical evidence from preliminary studies.</li><br><li> <b>Reporting Model Initialization Methods</b>: The initialization method for model weights can significantly affect performance, especially in deep learning architectures. The paper should specify how the models were initialized before training.</li><br><li> <b>Explicit Mention of Any Data Augmentation</b>: If any data augmentation techniques were utilized in the experiments (e.g., for increasing the robustness of the model to variations in input data), these should be clearly detailed.</li><br><li> <b>Software and Hardware Details</b>: To further aid in the reproducibility of the results, the paper should mention the software (including versions) used for experiments, such as the deep learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.), and hardware specifications (GPUs, CPUs).</li><br><li> <b>Random Seed Reporting</b>: For reproducibility, the paper should state if a random seed was used to ensure deterministic results during splitting of data, initialization of models, and any other stochastic process.</li><br><li> <b>Complete List of Hyperparameters for Best Model</b>: The paper mentions detailing hyperparameter settings in sections and an appendix. It would be advantageous to have a consolidated list or table of the hyperparameters used for the best-performing model(s).</li><br></ol>Feedback focusing on these key improvements can help the authors better align their answers and justifications with the NeurIPS submission guidelines, fundamentally improving the paper's quality in terms of clarity, thoroughness, and reproducibility.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> <b>Itemized, Actionable Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Documentation Sections</b>: The proposed author's justification mentions Sections 4, 5, and Appendix B for documentation on new assets. Ensure these sections specifically include clear documentation on the designed framework, training parameters, benchmark datasets used, and hyperparameter settings. Explicitly address how each component contributes to the research and its novelty, ensuring comprehensiveness.</li><br><li> <b>Structured Templates for Asset Documentation</b>: Incorporate structured templates for documenting the new assets, including datasets, code, and models. Templates should cover training details, license information, limitations, and consent for used assets. This structured approach will enhance reproducibility and transparency.</li><br><li> <b>License and Consent</b>: Clarify in the documentation (preferably in Appendix B or a dedicated section) the license under which the new assets are released and confirm that consent was obtained for the use of any proprietary or third-party assets. If any asset involves human data, detail the consent process.</li><br><li> <b>Anonymization of Assets for Review</b>: Ensure the paper's supplemental materials (code/datasets) are anonymized if they are directly linked. Consider using anonymized URLs or a generic repository to share the assets during the review process. Mention this anonymization explicitly in the documentation sections.</li><br><li> <b>Detail on Asset Use and Limitations</b>: Expand the documentation to include a detailed discussion on how the introduced assets (e.g., datasets, models) can be used by other researchers. Address potential limitations or biases in the assets to guide future work and applications wisely.</li><br><li> <b>Enhanced Meta-Information for Datasets</b>: For any introduced datasets, provide enhanced meta-information covering the collection process, data preprocessing steps, dataset splits (training/validation/testing), and any preprocessing scripts used. This information is critical for reproducibility and should be included in Appendix B or a dedicated dataset documentation section.</li><br><li> <b>Code Documentation and Usability</b>: Ensure the provided code is well-documented, with comments explaining critical sections and a README file detailing setup instructions, dependencies, and usage examples. Highlight any framework-specific requirements (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch versions) clearly.</li><br><li> <b>Benchmark and Evaluation Script</b>: Alongside the main assets, provide a benchmark script for evaluating the models or algorithms introduced. This script should automate the evaluation process against the provided or referenced datasets, showing how performance metrics are calculated.</li><br></ol></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' response and justification correctly highlight that their paper does not involve crowdsourcing experiments or research with human subjects, thus marking the checklist question as "NA" (Not Applicable). This aligns with the guidelines provided, which stipulate that if a paper does not involve certain elements (such as crowdsourcing or human subjects research), marking the question as "NA" is appropriate. Given the content of the paper, which focuses on architecture search in Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for traffic prediction, there is no indication or necessity for involvement with human subjects or crowdsourcing experiments. Therefore, there are no discrepancies between the authors' answer and the content of the paper regarding this specific checklist question.<br>To ensure the quality of the paper and adherence to NeurIPS guidelines, here are key areas for possible improvement, based on the documentation provided:<br><ol><li> <b>Verification of Dataset Ethics Compliance</b>: While not directly related to the question at hand, ensuring that any data used, even if not derived from human subjects directly, complies with ethical standards is paramount. The authors should verify and, if applicable, include statements confirming that their dataset sourcing and usage comply with ethical guidelines.</li><br><li> <b>Transparent Methodology</b>: Though this checklist item was marked as "NA", it provides a good point of reflection for the authors to ensure that all other aspects of their methodology are transparent and detailed. This includes data preprocessing, model training details, and hyperparameter selection processes not involving human subjects but are crucial for replicating the study's results.</li><br><li> <b>Detailing Contributions and Limitations</b>: While directly not applicable, this question hints at the broader need to clearly outline the paper's contributions and any limitations it may have, including potential biases in the non-human-derived data or in the model architecture search process.</li><br><li> <b>Comprehensive Experiment Design Documentation</b>: For completeness, the paper should ensure that all experiment designs, including those not involving humans, are documented in detail, allowing for reproducibility and scrutiny by the research community.</li><br><li> <b>Future Work Suggestions</b>: While the current research may not involve human subjects, identifying any potential for future work that might involve crowdsourcing or human subjects could enrich the discussion section. This might include user studies to evaluate the practical utility of the proposed models in real-world scenarios.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors can enhance the clarity, reproducibility, and ethical adherence of their research, ensuring it meets NeurIPS' high standards.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> Feedback:<br><ol><li> Clarify the Scope of Human Subjects Research: The paper strongly argues that the study does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects, thus marking the IRB approval question as not applicable (NA). However, given the application areas mentioned (e.g., traffic prediction, smart transportation), it's important to explicitly clarify early in the manuscript (preferably in the introduction or methodological framework sections) that no data was collected directly from human subjects or involved human interaction that would require ethical review. This will reinforce the NA justification regarding IRB approvals and ethical considerations.</li><br><li> Address Potential Indirect Risks: While direct human subject involvement is denied, the paper should also consider and briefly discuss any potential indirect risks or ethical implications associated with the deployment of the proposed models in real-world settings (e.g., privacy concerns related to traffic data, potential biases in traffic prediction models, and their implications). This discussion doesnâ€™t have to be extensive but should acknowledge awareness of these issues, how they might be mitigated, and affirm the commitment to ethical AI development practices.</li><br><li> Data Source and Privacy: The manuscript mentions using datasets from public sources for traffic forecasting tasks. It would be prudent to include a brief statement about the sourcing of this data, ensuring it complies with privacy laws and guidelines, and confirming that the data usage does not introduce ethical concerns. If the datasets are publicly available and widely used in research, citing prior studies that utilized these datasets can help support this claim.</li><br><li> Expansion of the Justification Section: While the justification for marking the IRB question as NA is clear, expanding this section to briefly cover the above points will make the ethical considerations of the paper robust. This is increasingly important in AI research, and taking a proactive stance on these issues can only benefit the paper.</li><br><li> Future Work Section: It could be valuable to include a future work section that discusses potential applications of the studyâ€™s findings in real-world scenarios while acknowledging the necessary ethical considerations and measures that will be taken to address them. This will demonstrate a forward-looking approach to responsibly translating research findings into practice.</li><br><br></ol></div>
