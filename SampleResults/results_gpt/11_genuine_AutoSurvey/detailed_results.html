            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer indicates a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the guidelines provided for discussing limitations within the paper. The authors state "No" as the answer to whether the paper discusses the limitations of the work performed, justifying this by saying that the conclusion mentions room for improvement but not the limitations explicitly. Based on the provided guidelines, discussing limitations is crucial for acknowledging the scope of the paper's claims, the robustness of the results, any strong assumptions made, computational efficiency, and potential drawbacks concerning privacy, fairness, etc. Therefore, simply mentioning "room for improvement" does not suffice as a thorough discussion of a study's limitations.<br><h3>Actionable Feedback:</h3><ol><li> <b>Introduce a Limitations Section</b>: The authors should consider adding a dedicated "Limitations" section, explicitly discussing the constraints and potential drawbacks of their approach. This could include the scalability of the proposed methods to different or larger datasets, sensitivity to certain parameters, or limitations in the evaluation metrics or baseline comparisons employed in the study.</li><br><li> <b>Detail Assumptions and Scope</b>: Clarify any strong assumptions made in developing the models or methods and discuss how these assumptions might limit the applicability or generalizability of the findings. Also, articulate the scope of the claims made more clearly to specify contexts or scenarios where the proposed solutions are either not applicable or would require significant modification.</li><br><li> <b>Discuss Computational Efficiency</b>: Include an assessment of the computational resources required for the proposed methods, especially if large language models are core to the approach. Highlight any limitations related to computational cost, time, and the feasibility of operation on a larger scale or with more complex datasets.</li><br><li> <b>Reflect on the Diversity of Tested Scenarios</b>: If the approach was tested on a narrow set of prompts or domains, discuss this as a limitation. Encourage future work to explore a broader diversity of disciplines or prompt complexities to validate the robustness and versatility of the proposed models further.</li><br><li> <b>Address Potential Biases and Fairness Concerns</b>: If applicable, discuss how the model might perpetuate or amplify existing biases in the datasets or in the generated content. Offer insights into how such issues were mitigated or could be addressed in future work.</li><br><li> <b>Acknowledge any Non-addressed Aspects</b>: If certain potential limitations or concerns (e.g., privacy, ethical considerations of autonomous content generation) were not directly addressed in this work, acknowledge these areas as limitations and suggest them as directions for future research.</li><br></ol>By incorporating these elements, the authors can strengthen their paper by demonstrating a thoughtful and comprehensive understanding of their work's context, applicability, and potential impact, including acknowledging where further inquiry and development are necessary.<br></div>

Although the authors claimed that their work is not theoretical and hence marked the question as not applicable (NA), a closer examination of the paper reveals instances where theoretical considerations, particularly related to the evaluation methods and baseline results, are indeed present and critical for the comprehension and reproducibility of the research.<br><ol><li> <b>Clarification of Methods Used</b>: The section on evaluation methods and baseline results indirectly involves theoretical underpinning regarding the design, implementation, and interpretation of the AI constructs used in the study. These sections imply a need for clear assumptions regarding the operation, limitations, and expected performance of the AI systems tasking with authoring and reviewing survey papers.</li><br><li> <b>Definition and Justification of Evaluation Criteria</b>: The paper outlines several evaluation criteria (Relevance, Contribution, Soundness, Clarity, Responsibility) used to assess the quality of generated survey papers. These criteria, while applied practically, rest upon theoretical frameworks of assessment that necessitate clear definitions and the reasoning behind their selection and application.</li><br></ol>Given these observations, the authors are advised to:<br><ul><li><b>Reassess the Theoretical Components</b>: Identify and acknowledge the theoretical aspects within the evaluation framework and baseline results sections. This includes any assumptions made during the design of the evaluation criteria and the interpretation of results.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Provide Clarity and Justification</b>: Amend the current NA response to address the indirect theoretical underpinnings of their research. This could involve outlining the assumptions regarding the capabilities of the AI systems used and the rationale behind the chosen evaluation metrics.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Document Assumptions and Theoretical Frameworks</b>: Ensure that any assumptions made about the technology, evaluation process, or theoretical frameworks used are clearly stated and justified to facilitate comprehension and reproducibility.</li><br><li><b>Reference Relevant Theoretical Work</b>: Where applicable, reference existing theoretical work or frameworks that support the design and implementation of the AI systems and evaluation methods detailed in the paper.</li><br></ul>By addressing these points, the authors will strengthen the integrity and comprehensibility of their work, ensuring that it adheres more closely to the guidelines provided.<br></div>

This response indicates a significant discrepancy with the expectations laid out in the guidelines for NeurIPS submissions.<br><b>Actionable Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Detailed Methodology Description:</b> Authors should include a comprehensive section dedicated to describing the methodologies employed in the experiments. This should encompass the algorithms used, including versions (e.g., ChatGPT version GPT-3.5 as mentioned), parameters, and any modifications made to standard procedures. If exact reproduction is not feasible due to variability in AI outputs, the authors should aim to provide enough detail so that the study can be replicated with similar outcomes.</li><br><li> <b>Data and Prompts Accessibility:</b> Considering the challenge revolves around generating and evaluating survey papers based on prompts, it is essential to provide or describe how one might access these prompts and any relevant datasets. If direct provision is not possible, a detailed description of how the prompts were generated and how similar datasets can be constructed should be offered.</li><br><li> <b>Baseline Implementation Details:</b> The paper details the use of baseline methods for both the AI-Author and AI-Reviewer tasks.

The guidelines clearly state the necessity of disclosing the types of compute workers (e.g., CPU, GPU), the hosting environment (internal cluster or cloud service), along with relevant memory, storage capacities, and the compute time for both individual experimental runs and the entire research project.<br>However, the justification falls short by not offering any rationale for this omission, such as computational expense or oversight. The paper involves the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 for composing and critiquing academic surveys, which undoubtedly requires substantial computational resources that vary significantly based on model parameters, dataset sizes, and execution times.

Upon examining the content of the paper, it is clear that the paper's focus is on the design, evaluation, and impacts of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating the literature review process. Given the nature of this work, there are significant areas for potential negative societal impacts, notably around the misuse of LLMs, biases in AI-generated content, privacy concerns, and the ethical implications of AI in academic research. The justification provided by the authors recognizes a gap in addressing these negative societal impacts. Thus, the authors need to improve their manuscript based on the following actionable feedback aligning with the NeurIPS guidelines:<br><ol><li> <b>Inclusion of a dedicated section for Societal Impact</b>: Authors should include a new section that systematically analyzes both the positive and negative societal implications of their work. This should encompass potential misuse of automated literature review tools, such as generating biased or incorrect summaries of scientific literature, and how this could impact public knowledge or policy making.</li><br><li> <b>Discussion on Mitigation Strategies</b>: Within the newly added societal impacts section, the authors should not only discuss potential negative impacts but also propose mitigation strategies. For instance, they could suggest incorporating robustness checks against misinformation, bias detection mechanisms, and user education on the limitations of LLM-produced literature reviews.</li><br><li> <b>Strengthening the Justification for Not Including Negative Impacts</b>: If there are valid reasons for not discussing negative societal implications in depth (e.g., due to the foundational nature of the research or current technological constraints), these reasons should be explicitly stated and thoroughly justified in the paper. This may involve a deeper reflection on the stage of development of their tool and its proximity to actual deployment in academic settings.</li><br><li> <b>Referencing Relevant Literature</b>: The authors should anchor their discussion of societal impacts in existing literature, citing studies on similar AI technologies' societal implications, and engaging with ongoing debates within AI ethics and policy research. This will provide a richer context for their work's potential societal roles.</li><br><li> <b>Reflect on Long-term Implications</b>: Broadening the scope of the discussion to include long-term societal implications could significantly enhance the paper's contribution. This might involve speculating on how automated literature reviews could transform academic research practices, publication norms, and the accessibility of knowledge.</li><br></ol>By addressing these areas, the authors will not only adhere to the NeurIPS guidelines but also enrich their paper with a more holistic view of their technology's societal implications, thus providing valuable insights for readers and encouraging responsible AI development and use.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-green "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors correctly answered "NA" as their paper, on the surface, does not directly involve crowdsourcing experiments or research with human subjects in the conventional sense of collecting data through human experiment participation. Their research focuses on the evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating and reviewing academic content, specifically within an organized competition setting. This implies no direct interaction with human subjects in the data collection process, which is typically the focus of IRB concerns and the related checklist questions regarding instructions, screenshots, and compensation.<br>However, there is an aspect that could be considered indirectly involving human participants, given the competition involves human organizers (in editorial oversight capacities) and possibly human participants for final code submission evaluation in the "final test phase". Though these roles do not equate to traditional experimental subjects, and compensation details for competitors are outside the scope of the NeurIPS checklist requirement unless the competition setup directly involved experimental crowdsourcing tasks, one could argue for the inclusion of a brief explanation of the human involvement in these capacities. This could be especially relevant in addressing ethical considerations related to the organization and execution of the competition itself, rather than the development of the AI systems.<br>Feedback to improve the paper quality in alignment with the guidelines:<ol><li> Clarification: Provide a brief section or statement clarifying the roles of human participants in the competition to preempt and address any potential ethical concerns, even if indirectly related to the research. This also includes any editorial oversight roles.</li><li> Ethical considerations: Although not directly related to crowdsourcing or human subject research, it would strengthen the paper to discuss any considerations taken to ensure fair and ethical treatment of all participants (human or AI), especially in terms of compensation for human contributors or organizers, if applicable.</li><li> Transparency: Consider including an appendix or a section in the supplementary material that outlines the competition rules, including participant consent (if required), participant data privacy (if any personal data of participants were handled), and the ethical review process. This adds to the transparency and integrity of the research design, even if not directly in the purview of traditional human subjects research.</li><br></ol>Considering the response is appropriate given the research context but minor improvements could enhance clarity and address any underlying ethical considerations indirectly related to human involvement, the score is:<br><br></div>

                <p><strong class="question">Question # 15:</strong> Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?</p>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer of "NA" to the question about disclosing potential risks to study participants and obtaining IRB approval is inconsistent with the content of the paper, as described in the provided text. The paper involves the development and testing of AI systems to autonomously compose and critique academic papers, a task that involves human-like cognitive functions and could raise ethical considerations particularly around the generation and evaluation of content that could potentially include sensitive or biased information. Additionally, the paper mentions the involvement of human organizers in an editorial oversight capacity and the evaluation of submissions by a human jury, which indicates human participation at some level of the research process.<br>Given this context, the authors should reconsider their response to the question concerning potential risks to participants, disclosure to the subjects, and IRB approvals. Here are a few actionable suggestions:<br><ol><li> <b>Risk Assessment</b>: Conduct a thorough risk assessment related to the use and outcomes of the AI systems being tested. This includes assessing risks of generating biased, incorrect, or ethically questionable content and the impact this might have on individuals or groups.</li><br><li> <b>Ethical Review and IRB Approval</b>: If the project involves human organizers and evaluators, an ethical review, possibly leading to IRB approval, may be required. The authors should clarify the role of these individuals and assess whether their involvement constitutes human subjects research, which would necessitate an IRB review.</li><br><li> <b>Disclosure and Consent</b>: If it is determined that the project involves human research subjects, the authors need to ensure that proper disclosure is made to these subjects about the risks involved and that informed consent is obtained. This process should be outlined in the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Update Paper Accordingly</b>: Revise the relevant sections of the paper to accurately reflect the steps taken to address ethical considerations, including any IRB review or exemption and measures taken to mitigate potential risks. If no IRB review was required, a justification should be provided based on the specific ethical guidelines followed.</li><br><li> <b>Reference to NeurIPS Code of Ethics</b>: Explicitly mention adherence to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, especially in relation to responsible AI development and research involving human participants or impacts. Illustrate how the research aligns with these ethical standards.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors can ensure that their research is conducted responsibly and that the paper accurately reflects the ethical considerations of their work.<br><br></div>
