This addition will make it easier for readers and reviewers to locate and verify the claims made.</li><br><li> <b>Clarification of Claims:</b> It is advisable to ensure that the claims made in the abstract and introduction are mirrored exactly in the main text of the paper. If any claim has not been explicitly addressed or proven in the subsequent sections, authors should consider revising the claim to accurately reflect the paper's content or adding the necessary evidence or discussion in the main text.</li><br><li> <b>Limitations and Assumptions:</b> Given the guideline advice on including important assumptions and limitations of the paper's contributions, the authors should also ensure these are clearly stated in the sections mentioned in their revised justification. If they are not already clearly articulated in the paper, they should be added to comply fully with the guidelines.</li><br><li> <b>Direct Comparison:</b> If there are aspirational goals mentioned in the abstract or introduction, there should be a clear indication within the paper (and reflected in the justification) where the current achievements are juxtaposed with these goals, highlighting what has been attained versus what remains out of reach.</li><br><li> <b>Consistent Terminology:</b> Ensure that the terminology and nomenclature used to describe the paper’s contributions and findings in the abstract and introduction are consistent throughout the paper. This consistency aids in clarity and prevents misunderstandings regarding the scope and implications of the work.</li><br><li> <b>Broader Impact and Generalization:</b> If the paper makes claims about the potential for generalization of its findings or its broader impact, there should be a section devoted to discussing these aspects in depth, possibly in the discussion or conclusion. This inclusion will ensure that readers grasp the full scope and potential applicability of the research.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors will improve the alignment between their paper's introductory sections and its detailed contributions, thus better adhering to the conference's submission guidelines.<br></div>

However, the feedback below aims to ensure comprehensive coverage and clarity in their discussion on limitations, based on the guidelines and the complexity of the study performed.<br><h3>Actionable Feedback</h3><br><ol><li> <b>Clarify the Scope of Testing</b>:</li></ol>- The paper presents a large-scale study and experiments, including a randomized controlled trial. It is key to clarify whether the limitations discussed in section 5.1 include limitations associated with the study's design, participant selection, and any biases that might not have been fully addressed in the methodology.<br><ol><li> <b>Address Generalizability</b>:</li></ol>- Assess whether the limitations explicitly discuss the generalizability of the findings to peer review processes outside NeurIPS or to fields beyond computer science/machine learning. If not, add a discussion on how the specific context of NeurIPS 2022 may influence the findings and their applicability to other domains or review settings.<br><ol><li> <b>Expand on Limitations of Data Analysis</b>:</li></ol>- Ensure that the limitations section includes critical reflection on the data analysis methods. For example, discuss any assumptions made in statistical tests, the impact of potential confounders not accounted for, and the limitations in interpreting the causality of observed biases.<br><ol><li> <b>Include Technical Limitations</b>:</li></ol>- If not already present, detail any technical limitations related to the computational tools or algorithms used for analyzing the review and evaluation data. This is particularly relevant if automated methods were employed to assess review quality or if there were challenges in handling the data scale.<br><ol><li> <b>Discuss Ethical and Privacy Considerations</b>:</li></ol>- While the guidelines do not explicitly mention ethics or privacy under limitations, given the sensitive nature of peer review, it’s advisable to include any limitations related to privacy protection of participants and ethical considerations in analyzing their responses.<br><ol><li> <b>Reflect on Methodological Challenges</b>:</li></ol>- Provide a thorough examination of any methodological challenges faced during the study, such as difficulties in operationalizing review quality, or challenges in the randomized controlled trial design that could affect the reliability or validity of the findings.<br><ol><li> <b>Critical Evaluation of Interventions Tested</b>:</li></ol>- Explicitly address the limitations of the interventions tested within the peer review process, including any assumptions held during the experimental design and potential impacts of these interventions on reviewer behavior not captured in the study.<br><ol><li> <b>Impact of Participation Bias</b>:</li></ol>- If the discussion on limitations does not already encompass the impact of selection bias due to the opt-in nature of participant recruitment, it is essential to include an evaluation of how this might affect the results and their interpretation.<br>By addressing these points, the paper will provide a comprehensive view of its limitations, enhancing its credibility and contributing valuable insights for future research in peer review evaluation processes.<br></div>

The paper intricately details experimental setups, analyses, and findings rather than expounding on purely theoretical results. This distinction is vital for appropriately responding to the checklist question.<br><ol><li> <b>Clarify Nature of Results</b>: The authors should explicitly state that the document focuses on empirical studies and analyses rather than theoretical derivations. This clarification will align the response to the checklist question with the content of the paper, demonstrating an understanding that theoretical proofs are not applicable to the presented work.</li><br><li> <b>Reference Relevant Sections</b>: Although the answer to the question is deemed "NA," it would enhance the document's clarity to guide readers to sections discussing the experimental design, data analysis, and findings. This approach aids in understanding the empirical basis of the study, further supporting the assertion of "NA" to the question about theoretical results.</li><br><li> <b>Explicitly State Absence of Theoretical Results</b>: To eliminate any ambiguity, the authors should explicitly state within the relevant section(s) (e.g., Introduction or Methodology) that the paper is grounded in empirical research and does not aim to provide or require theoretical results or proofs. Such an explicit statement within the paper preemptively addresses the checklist question.</li><br><li> <b>Elaborate on Methodological Rigor</b>: Even in the absence of theoretical results, discussing the rigor and justification behind the chosen experimental and analytical methods can provide a form of reassurance about the study's robustness. This detail will underscore the scientific value of the work, despite the lack of theoretical proofs.</li><br><li> <b>Consider Including a Discussion on Theoretical Implications</b>: As an enhancement, the authors could discuss any potential implications their empirical findings might have on existing theories or future theoretical work. This addition would not only substantiate the decision to mark "NA" for theoretical proofs but also bridge the gap between empirical findings and theoretical understanding in the field.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors will present a more coherent rationale for the "NA" answer, aligning it more closely with the actual content and focus of the paper. This approach ensures that the omission of theoretical proofs is justified and understood in the context of the paper's empirical nature.<br></div>

These details are crucial for ensuring that the experiments can be independently reproduced, which is a cornerstone of scientific rigor and contributes to the advancement of the field by allowing other researchers to verify findings, explore the implications further, or build upon the work.<br><b>Actionable Feedback:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Explicitly Mention Sections for Reproducibility:</b> While the authors state that every empirical result precedes a methods section detailing the work, it is critical to explicitly mention the section numbers or titles where the methods and experimental setups are described. This clarity will help readers and reviewers easily locate the information necessary for replication.</li><br><li> <b>Detail Data Accessibility:</b> If the study relies on specific datasets, the paper should clearly mention how these datasets can be accessed or reproduced by others. In case of proprietary or sensitive data that cannot be shared, the authors should provide a detailed description of the dataset characteristics and, if possible, a synthetic dataset that can be used to replicate the main findings.</li><br><li> <b>Code Availability:</b> Although NeurIPS does not require releasing code, sharing the software or code used in the experiments significantly enhances reproducibility. If code is available, include a statement about where it can be accessed. If it is not shared, provide a justification and possibly include pseudocode or detailed algorithms that were used.</li><br><li> <b>Detailed Hyperparameters and Model Architectures:</b> For experiments involving machine learning models, it is essential to provide exhaustive details about model architectures, hyperparameters, training procedures, and any initialization strategies. This detail ensures that others can replicate the study’s results without ambiguity.</li><br><li> <b>Statistical Analysis Repeatability:</b> Clearly describe the statistical methods and metrics used to analyze the data. Specify any software or custom scripts used for statistical tests, including version numbers and parameters.</li><br><li> <b>Address Limitations on Reproducibility:</b> If there are any limitations or considerations that might affect the ability to reproduce results (e.g., computational resources required, version dependencies), these should be clearly stated. Providing such information helps others plan their replication studies appropriately.</li><br><li> <b>Experimental Conditions:</b> If the study includes experiments (e.g., the mentioned randomized controlled trial), ensure that all conditions, manipulations, and measurements are described with sufficient detail to allow replication. This includes participant recruitment criteria, experimental design decisions, and analysis methods.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors will significantly improve the reproducibility of their work, adhering not only to NeurIPS guidelines but also contributing to the integrity and advancement of scientific research.<br></div>

To enhance the quality of the paper in alignment with the NeurIPS conference guidelines for reporting statistical significance, the following itemized, actionable feedback is suggested:<br><ol><li> <b>Specify the Location of Statistical Analysis</b>: While the authors mention that plots and result tables include error bars or other information about statistical significance, they should explicitly indicate the sections or figure/table numbers where these details can be found. This will aid readers in easily locating and understanding the statistical tests and confidence intervals used.</li><br><li> <b>Clarify Variability Factors and Error Bar Types</b>: The authors should clearly describe which factors of variability the error bars are capturing (e.g., train/test split, random initialization) and specify whether the error bars represent standard deviation, standard error of the mean, or confidence intervals. If using 1-sigma or 2-sigma error bars, this should be explicitly stated.</li><br><li> <b>Explain Methodology for Calculating Error Bars</b>: A brief explanation or reference to the methodology used for calculating the error bars (whether it's a closed form formula, bootstrap, library function, etc.) will improve the reproducibility and credibility of the statistical analysis reported in the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Address Assumptions and Distribution Type</b>: If the paper assumes normally distributed errors for the calculation of error bars, this assumption should be mentioned. Additionally, for asymmetric distributions, the authors should ensure that the reported error bars (if symmetric) do not imply out-of-range values, or consider using other forms of reporting such as confidence intervals that more accurately represent the data distribution.</li><br><li> <b>Reference Error Bars in Text</b>: Wherever applicable, the text should reference specific figures or tables that contain error bars or statistical tests. This not only serves to guide the reader but also emphasizes the rigor of the experimental analysis.</li><br><li> <b>Discuss Statistical Significance</b>: Beyond reporting error bars and statistical tests, discussing their implications on the results' reliability and the conclusions drawn can greatly enhance the reader's understanding and trust in the study's findings.</li><br></ol>Implementing these recommendations will not only improve the rigor of the statistical analysis reported in the paper but also enhance its alignment with NeurIPS submission guidelines and increase its utility to the conference attendees and the wider research community.<br><br></div>

This includes specifying the hardware (CPU/GPU types), software environments, and any relevant configurations. If cloud services were used, details on the service type and configuration should be included.</li><li> <b>Clarify Execution Time</b>: Include an estimate of the runtime for each experiment, even if it is minimal. This provides a clearer expectation for researchers attempting to reproduce the work.</li><li> <b>Memory Usage</b>: Offer details on memory requirements for running the experiments. This is crucial for reproducibility, especially for researchers with limited access to computing resources.</li><li> <b>Rationale for Non-disclosure (if applicable)</b>: If there truly were negligible compute resources used, provide a rationale as to why disclosing such information is deemed unnecessary.

While this may not constitute a "new asset" in the traditional sense, providing these resources can aid in reproducibility and transparency.</li><br><li> Licensing and Permissions: Although the paper's focus does not inherently suggest the creation of licensable assets, if any part of the methodology, data, or analysis tools are shared within the paper or supplementary materials, include information about licensing or any permissions needed for their use.</li><br><li> Future Work and Asset Creation: If the conclusions of the paper suggest avenues for future research that might involve the creation of datasets, tools, or models, briefly discuss potential documentation and sharing strategies for these hypothetical assets. This shows foresight and a commitment to open access principles.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the authors can ensure their submission is transparent about the absence of conventional "new assets" while also demonstrating their commitment to open and reproducible research practices. Moreover, it would align the submission more closely with the expectations set by the NeurIPS guidelines regarding asset documentation and availability.<br><br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors' proposed answer to the checklist question regarding the inclusion of the full text of instructions given to participants, screenshots (if applicable), and details about compensation for crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects is affirmative, stating it is included in the appendix. However, despite this assertion, a detailed review of the provided paper sections and the appendix reveals a lack of explicit documentation or evidence supporting this claim within the paper's context as provided.<br><b>Feedback for Improvement:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Explicit Inclusion of Instructions and Screenshots:</b> Ensure that the appendix explicitly includes the full text of instructions given to participants. If the paper indeed involves human subjects, as the research context suggests, this detail is crucial for reproducibility and ethical transparency. If screenshots of interfaces used in experiments are applicable, these should be clearly displayed or described to give readers a complete understanding of the participant experience.</li><br><li> <b>Compensation Details:</b> Provide a clear statement or a section in the appendix detailing the compensation provided to the participants, if any. This should align with the ethical guidelines requiring fair compensation. Clarify the basis for compensation, such as the time spent by participants or the number of tasks completed, and ensure the compensation meets minimum wage standards or ethical guidelines relevant to the research's geographic context.</li><br><li> <b>Cross-referencing to Main Text:</b> In the main body of the paper, specifically mention the section or appendix where these details can be found. This cross-referencing improves navigation and ensures readers are aware of where to find the comprehensive details on the research methodology involving human participants.</li><br><li> <b>Ethical Approval and Consent:</b> Beyond the specific checklist question, ensure that the paper mentions any ethical approval obtained for the study and the process of informed consent with participants. This adds to the credibility and ethical standing of the research.</li><br><li> <b>Clarification on Participant Involvement:</b> Given that the research context involves the evaluation of reviews within a peer review process, clarify the extent of human subjects' involvement. Delineate between automated evaluations or interventions and those directly involving participants to provide clarity on the nature of the human subject research.</li><br></ol>By addressing these points, the paper will be aligned more closely with ethical research practices and reporting standards, enhancing its quality and rigor.<br></div>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> The authors have answered "No" to the question regarding the description of potential risks incurred by study participants, the disclosure of such risks, and the acquisition of IRB approvals. They justify this by noting that "IRB approval is not included in the text manuscript."<br><b>Feedback</b><br><ol><li> <b>Clarification on Human Subject Research</b>: The paper clearly involves research with human participants (reviewers, authors, and meta-reviewers), analyzing their behavior and perceptions within a study conducted at a conference. The authors should clarify whether this study involved data collection or interventions that could potentially affect the rights, well-being, or privacy of the participants, thereby necessitating ethical review.</li><br><li> <b>IRB Approval or Exemption Explanation</b>: Given the study involves human subjects, it should be stated whether the research received an Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval, or was granted an exemption. If such approvals or exemptions were sought or obtained, a brief statement to that effect (without institutional details that could compromise double-blind review) should be included. If the research did not seek IRB approval because it was deemed not to involve human subjects as understood under applicable regulations or because the risk to participants was minimal, this rationale should be clearly stated in the paper.</li><br><li> <b>Ethics and Consent</b>: Furthermore, the paper should address ethical considerations more broadly, including whether informed consent (or assent) was obtained from participants or whether consent was waived by the overseeing ethics body. This is particularly important given that the study involves evaluating the perceptions and reactions of individuals in a controlled experiment.</li><br><li> <b>Potential Risks and Mitigations</b>: The authors should discuss any potential risks to participants involved in the study, even if they are minimal, and how these risks were mitigated. This includes psychological discomfort, privacy concerns, or any other form of risk that participants might have been exposed to. If no risks were foreseen, it should be stated alongside the reasoning to support this conclusion.</li><br><li> <b>Impact of Findings on Participants</b>: The paper should briefly discuss whether the findings of the study have any implications for the participants’ privacy, reputation, or perception in their professional community. This includes post-publication impacts and how any potential negative outcomes were mitigated or planned to be addressed.</li><br></ol>Addressing these points will help to ensure that the paper meets ethical standards for research with human subjects and conforms to conference guidelines. Clarifying these aspects can also strengthen the trust of the readers and conference reviewers in the research process and its adherence to ethical norms.<br></div>
