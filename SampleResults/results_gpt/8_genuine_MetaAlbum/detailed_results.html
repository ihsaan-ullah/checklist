            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> <b>Feedback</b><br><ol><li> <b>Clarity and Detail in Dataset Description</b>:</li></ol>- Ensure the paper introduces each dataset within Meta-Album with sufficient detail regarding the sources, preprocessing methods, and unique challenges or characteristics. Consider adding a subsection dedicated to each domain, elucidating why these specific datasets were chosen and how they contribute to the diversity and robustness of the Meta-Album.<br><ol><li> <b>Uniformity in Data Preprocessing</b>:</li></ol>- There seems to be inconsistency in how different datasets under Meta-Album were preprocessed. For example, while some datasets underwent cropping and resizing, others also had augmentation techniques applied. It would be beneficial to standardize data preprocessing steps across all datasets to ensure uniformity, making explicit any domain-specific deviations and their justifications.<br><ol><li> <b>Explicit Discussion on Ethical Considerations</b>:</li></ol>- The paper should include a section on ethical considerations, especially pertaining to the data collection processes of the constituent datasets, privacy concerns, and any potential biases within the datasets. This is particularly crucial for datasets involving human subjects, such as the Human Actions domain.<br><ol><li> <b>Thorough Analysis of Societal Impacts</b>:</li></ol>- The paper claims no negative societal impacts, which seems an omission. All AI technologies carry potential for misuse or unintended negative consequences. A deeper analysis is required to identify possible negative societal impacts, especially in terms of privacy, surveillance, or biases that might be perpetuated through the use of these datasets. The paper should explore, even hypothetically, how Meta-Album might be used in ways that could lead to ethical dilemmas or societal harm and propose mitigation strategies.<br><ol><li> <b>Enhanced Documentation and Accessibility</b>:</li></ol>- To improve the usability and accessibility of Meta-Album, the paper should detail the availability of documentation and support resources. This includes clear guidelines on how to use the datasets, access to metadata, and any tools or scripts provided for data manipulation. The aim should be to lower the barrier to entry for researchers, especially those from underrepresented regions or institutions with limited resources.<br><ol><li> <b>Community Engagement and Dataset Contribution Guidelines</b>:</li></ol>- While the paper mentions the dataset’s extensibility, it should provide clearer guidelines on how the broader research community can contribute to Meta-Album. This includes submission protocols, review processes for new datasets, and standards for data formatting and annotation. Engaging the community in this manner can ensure continuous growth and diversity of the Meta-Album.<br><ol><li> <b>Benchmarking and Comparative Analysis</b>:</li></ol>- The paper would benefit from a detailed benchmarking section comparing Meta-Album’s performance against other popular datasets in few-shot learning and meta-learning. This would not only showcase Meta-Album's strengths but also provide insights into areas of improvement or gaps that future iterations of Meta-Album could address.<br></div>

                <p><strong class="question">Question # 11:</strong> Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?</p>
                <p><strong class="answer">Author's answer:</strong> Yes</p>
                <p><strong class="justification">Author's justification:</strong> Indeed, we are releasing our datasets with proper license and terms of use. We have also provided recommended usage of these datasets.</p>

            <div class="llm_review llm_review-orange "><strong>LLM Review:</strong><br> Based on the detailed provided information regarding the paper submission for NeurIPS conference about the Meta-Album: Multi-domain Meta-Dataset for Few-Shot Image Classification and the extensive appendices and detailed explanation, here are the areas that need improvement:<br><b>Feedback and Actionable Items:</b><br><ol><li> <b>Data Licensing and Usage Rights:</b> Verify the licensing information for every dataset included in the Meta-Album. The paper promises datasets with verified licenses; ensure explicit documentation in the appendix or a dedicated section to help researchers understand each dataset's usage constraints. Some datasets might have limitations not compatible with open commercial use, making it necessary to clarify these aspects to avoid misuse.</li><br><li> <b>Cross-Domain Generalizability Verification:</b> Enhancing the paper with more robust experiments showcasing the cross-domain few-shot learning capabilities of algorithms trained on Meta-Album can significantly add value. Conduct and report additional experiments to demonstrate how models trained on this meta-dataset perform across vastly different domains not represented within the dataset. This aspect is crucial for showcasing the Meta-Album's versatility and utility in realistic, highly varied tasks.</li><br><li> <b>Inclusion of More Diverse Domains:</b> While Meta-Album already includes a wide array of domains, continually working on expanding this variety can make it even more valuable. Plan for and outline how new domains may be added in the future, providing a roadmap for the dataset's expensibility. This strategy will also support the claim of the Meta-Album being an extendable dataset, encouraging contributions that fulfill emerging needs within the machine learning community.</li><br><li> <b>Benchmarking Against Existing Datasets:</b> The paper benefits from a direct, comprehensive comparison between Meta-Album and existing meta-datasets like Meta-Dataset, VTAB, or CIFAR-100. Include a detailed analysis or a separate section comparing the performance of few-shot learning models across these datasets versus Meta-Album. This comparative analysis should extend beyond dataset size and diversity, focusing on the real-world applicability and learning task performance.</li><br><li> <b>Clearer Guidelines for Contributions:</b> To facilitate community contributions to the Meta-Album, provide clearer, detailed guidelines on how external researchers can contribute new datasets or algorithms. This includes technical requirements, review processes, data quality standards, and ethical considerations. A dedicated section or an easily accessible external document linked within the paper can ensure this.</li><br><li> <b>Enhanced Quality Control and Bias Detection:</b> Expand on the methods used for dataset quality control and bias detection. While the GradCAM visualization technique is mentioned, the paper could benefit from a deeper dive into how biases detected through such techniques are handled or mitigated. Discussing the implications of these biases on model training and proposing strategies for their mitigation will significantly improve the paper's rigor and practical applicability.</li><br></ol><b>Conclusion:</b>The paper submission shows considerable potential in advancing the field of few-shot learning by introducing a diverse, multi-domain meta-dataset. Addressing the areas outlined above can substantially enhance its quality, making it more valuable for researchers and practitioners aiming to push the boundaries of machine learning generalizability across varied domains.<br></div>
