# Instructions

The authors of NeurIPS papers should use the [NeurIPS 2024 template](https://www.overleaf.com/project/65de0fefa3ebfdbfb779b024), which includes the checklist, at the end. The authors are invited to fill it out as accurately as possible. However, some answers can be left as [TODO], if the authors wish to get intermediate feedback.

The score shown on the leaderboard is the accuracy of the answers provided, as assessed by a large language model (LLM). All [TODO] answers will count as one error. A [NA] answer does not count as an error, if the LLM accepts the justification (that is, given the contents of the paper, the question is not applicable).
