# Overview 


*We provide a self-service checklist verification assistant, for the NeurIPS 2024 checklist, found at the bottom of the [LaTex style file](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2024/Styles.zip). This is NOT the NeurIPS paper submission system. The authors should submit their paper to OpenReviews for review by NeurIPS, see [CFP](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2024/CallForPapers). This is not a product, this is an experimental service based on a third party LLM (GPT-4 by OpenAI), provided as is. See our terms and conditions, in the Terms tab.*

### Synopsis

The academic review process is becoming more congested due to the rapid increase in the number of papers being produced. This surge is influenced by various factors, notably the pressure on researchers to publish for career advancement. While it may not be advisable to promote the creation of substandard research papers by enabling fully automated large-scale review production, easing the burden on reviewers and editors through partial automation of their tasks could enhance the quality of reviews. This would allow them to concentrate on aspects where their expertise is most crucial. An automated review process can also help authors themselves check any problems with their papers. 

In this experimental setting, we aim at helping authors verify their checklist before submitting their paper. 
* In phase 1, we welcome **genuine submissions** only of the author's own papers, with checklists filled with best effort. 
* In phase 2, we welcome **adversarial submissions**, containing errors concerning ethics, theory, or experiments, meant to test the LMM’s robustness to bad papers and/or dishonest checklist answers. We only authorize submissions of altered versions of the author's own papers and ask to reveal the design of the flaws introduced, for research purposes.
