In preparing this challenge, we received advice and help from many people. We are particularly grateful to the NeurIPS'24 organizers, including General Chair Amir Globerson, Senior Program Chair Danielle Belgrave and program co-chairs Cheng Zhang, Angela Fan, Jakub Tomczak, Ulrich Paquet, Babak Rahmani
for participating in brainstorming discussions and contributing to the design. We have discussed with them a possible NeurIPS'24 experiment to be held in conjunction with this challenge. We have also very early on received inputs and encouragements from Andrew McCallum of OpenReview and Anurag Acharya from Google Scholar. Several volunteers have contributed ideas and helped with various aspects for the challenge preparation, including Jeremiah Liu, Lisheng Sun, Paulo Henrique Couto, Michael Brenner, Neha Nayak Kennard, Nihar Shah, Adrien Pavao.
