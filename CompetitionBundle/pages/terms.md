To be eligible for participation, all users must adhere to the stipulated terms and conditions. **The organizing team retains the prerogative to make changes or additions to the terms and conditions at any time**. You must provide a valid email to be notified.

This challenge is for research and educational purposes only and no prizes are granted. It is hosted by ChaLearn and Codalab competitions and therefore it is governed by the [General ChaLearn Contest Rules](http://www.causality.inf.ethz.ch/GeneralChalearnContestRuleTerms.html) and the [terms of use of Codalab Competitions](https://github.com/codalab/codalab-competitions/wiki/Privacy), and the other conditions set forth. The users grant permission to the organizing team to analyze their submissions, but retain ownership of their submissions.

The organizing team provides this service to assist authors with verifying the compliance of their paper with the NeurIPS 2024 checklist and conduct research on improving the NeurIPS checklist. It is based on a third party large language model ([GPT-4 by OpenA](https://openai.com/gpt-4)I). **The users are required to only submit papers that are their own and seek permission from their co-authors to do so.** This service is not for use by third parties, including reviewers.  Please refrain from submitting papers that are not your own. The users are advised that their paper will be sent to the API of OpenAI, and thus be treated under the conditions of confidentiality of OpenAI. We recommend to only submit anonymized papers.

This service aims to assist users in writing good papers, it is not a substitute for the anyoneâ€™s critical thinking and expertise. This service is provided "as is", and the organizing team and the sponsors (including NeurIPS and OpenReviews) decline any express or implied warranties, and they are not liable for any direct or indirect consequential damages, including, but not limited to, errors in the evaluations or incorrect claims made, public exposure or loss of data, and interruption of service, however caused.

Any external links included in a paper submission are excluded from processing. The content generated by this service does not consider or analyze external links and should not be interpreted in connection with them. Thus the authors are invited to include in the main body of their paper or the attached appendix (included in the same submitted PDF) all relevant information to support the answers to the checklist questions.

This is NOT the NeurIPS paper submission system. The authors should submit their paper to OpenReviews for review by NeurIPS. They are reminded to exercise their own discretion and judgment when utilizing this service and to adhere to all NeurIPS guidelines and policies when submitting their paper for review to NeurIPS 2024.
